hello

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Michael Powney>
yep

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.900
<v Michael Powney>
what is the NOT function supposed to do?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Michael Powney>
thanks

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Michael Powney>
isn't that the same as 1's complement though?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.900
<v Jay Thennampattu Chandrasekaran>
Should the program and exe be main compulsarily? Eclipse defaults mine to project name.c and exe.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.900
<v Jay Thennampattu Chandrasekaran>
Ok.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.900
<v Jay Thennampattu Chandrasekaran>
Thanks.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.900
<v Jay Thennampattu Chandrasekaran>
And is it fine if I just stick with C project rather than C++?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:22.900
<v Jay Thennampattu Chandrasekaran>
Ok. Thanks. 

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.900
<v Michael Powney>

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.900
<v Jay Thennampattu Chandrasekaran>
I had a dll error while executing the exe file. had to add PATH variable. I mentioned the same in the readme file. Just an alert.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.900
<v Jay Thennampattu Chandrasekaran>
ohh ok. I was able to solve my missing dll by googling.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:01.900
<v Michael Powney>
👌 

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:47.900
<v Jay Thennampattu Chandrasekaran>
