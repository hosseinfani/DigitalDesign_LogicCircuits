fflush(stdout) works

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.900
<v Michael Powney>
But you have to do it for every scanf

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.900
<v Connor Horman>
Yeah.

integer overflow

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:39.900
<v Ahmad Nassar>
integer overflow 

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.900
<v Andrew Simon>
so when it overflows from the top it goes to the lowest available number?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.900
<v Isaac Kilbourne>
Mhm

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:43.900
<v Isaac Kilbourne>
Because of the way the sign bit works

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:16.900
<v Kevin Liu>
so if we take the lowest number and subtract 1 would ir return 2147483647?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:22.900
<v Kevin Liu>
it*

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.900

It should do, yes.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.900

We need an algorithm to solve what's going on in usa.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.900
<v Isaac Kilbourne>
The algorithm is very simple: while True: ignore

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:36.900
<v Connor Horman>
Is attendence for the lab mandatory if you don't have any questions?

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:53.900

the book is not neccessary?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:47.900
<v Adam Taylor>
Are the assignments based off the current week information or the previous week information

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:48.900
<v Ryohei Takamori>
sometimes blackboard glitches out and doesnt let you submit labs or assignments this happened to me a lot last semester, who do we tell if this was to occur?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:37.900
<v Adam Taylor>
So even though it's posted on Monday, it's not really beneficial to start until Friday?

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:15.900

Is attendence for the lab mandatory if you don't have any questions?
