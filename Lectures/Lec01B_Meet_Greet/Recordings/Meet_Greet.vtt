00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:46.091
an example where it's not enough
to know only how to model the

00:20:09.264 --> 00:20:14.150

eeb43fff-68ca-45e2-9c06-ff21690b2fe1
00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:24.064
we will start coding in C

00:27:10.958 --> 00:27:15.417
This is defined that it's open for
you, that's there. So now we're

d36bfba0-efb4-464a-801b-fb1ec8ee3285
00:27:15.417 --> 00:27:17.818
going to write a program to just

139e725d-aa35-4075-bcf9-be85cd8be6fc
00:27:17.818 --> 00:27:23.190
add 2 numbers. So in the C
language, any problem can be

NOTE Confidence: 0.85858595

eaf06fdf-192f-4968-ae67-6443dc7c5636
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.990
reduced to a function. So a
function has a return type,

NOTE Confidence: 0.85858595

352435e8-67f3-426e-afa5-770b70b4abbc
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:31.930
so this is the return of an
addition and we pick a name

NOTE Confidence: 0.85858595

c39ffbe1-ab41-4ba2-b9c6-d7fc6edf14dc
00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:35.730
for the function. For
adding two numbers, we need

NOTE Confidence: 0.85858595

1cd67b50-dfa9-4dd4-b941-280a120c31fa
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.910
an input, a pair of numbers,
integer A and integer B.

998ab117-0edd-4637-b087-5c91ace0ba40
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:48.220
And then we create a result of
the Function A+B. So in

78dd059a-dbb2-4f35-9e6f-25ec789ec35d
00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.970
order to solve the addition
problem, we just use the

a4e776a3-1fa7-4889-b424-4ac124bd8fe8
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.345
plus operator (+) in the C language.

a4b48a11-50d4-439b-876f-5832293ffc2a
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.720
And then return a result.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8571501

ebde2eaf-2bf6-466a-a900-35f4ffd653a6
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:09.686
But this is the most simplest
program, so actually we haven't

NOTE Confidence: 0.8571501

8923fa23-bcda-4520-a012-9bed67d418f4
00:28:09.686 --> 00:28:14.702
solved the problem of summation.
We just use the sum operator

NOTE Confidence: 0.8571501

1a3be1fb-35a5-4ff5-a5f8-cb250b91eb0b
00:28:14.702 --> 00:28:20.630
in the C language. So let's just
test this function to see

7de63219-527e-410f-b2a7-0c3299d0981f
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:26.558
that it is possible to solve the
addition. So let's ask the user

612d7203-2b09-4bd4-966b-039c79db44ca
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.718
To enter 2 numbers.

1f62b69d-e187-463d-8c6f-a4d30fa34d87
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:41.450
And then if the user inputs 2
numbers, we have to receive.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8698333

17732bc2-a2c5-42c3-b405-85384677e0ca
00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.490
receive those two

ad242544-81c0-46b9-9ae8-0bae2e99c1a2
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:51.182
numbers, so numbers are on the
symbol, so you know when we

c28ec637-558c-439b-9bbe-4f1818c5cc90
00:28:51.182 --> 00:28:55.874
receive the input from the
user, you have to store it in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8698333

8fc09824-22ca-4bfe-a0dd-6ff1550008a6
00:28:55.874 --> 00:28:59.784
a variable as you know. So
let's create two variables

ccfb7aa3-f73c-4baa-91a2-57069656ec26
00:28:59.784 --> 00:29:01.739
number1 and number2.

b691e486-89f2-4743-97c4-4f54ba750402
00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:08.477
Also, we have to store the
results somewhere. We could call

00:29:08.477 --> 00:29:09.878
the results sum.

d934323b-28a3-4d75-9749-2f5bbeaf5f9a
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:15.060
So the first number the
user enters you can store

NOTE Confidence: 0.8944494

91c00798-b815-48df-ae90-49d8b51187ea
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:18.790
it in a variable number in
the variable number2.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9245546

4e85c3b4-22c8-4b57-ae2c-3cd63ee3063a
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:24.150
So then we ask the user
to enter another number.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8649563

1ca4e4eb-8d06-4964-ba2a-3e25c8903486
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.720
I'm just living number the

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:38.151
And then we say that sum is
equal to. Now we have to

f0fd3db5-96a8-4b1c-b787-07b3c48b8510
00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:41.327
call the function in order
to add the

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:48.244
2 numbers given by the user.
So we call the Add number

6093344d-048b-4010-becc-e7bf585e30ec
00:29:48.244 --> 00:29:52.814

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.036
And then at the end we have to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.724797

f6c38459-5609-4640-b75f-cc0381bbe418
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.040
Enter result.

69217556-8c5d-40bf-861d-9132bfa139ff
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.970
So. We say that.

1c92309c-9d6b-46cb-bb04-7351dd368266
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:08.354
This number plus this number (%d + %d).

1aa7970d-d036-4bdd-8150-e4e4859545bb
00:30:08.354 --> 00:30:12.422
These are all formatted
specifiers in the scanner for the printf

NOTE Confidence: 0.80761206

6ec5a3fc-5111-4c23-a16c-1c50182143a1
00:30:12.422 --> 00:30:17.394
function. So it determines how
to interpret the numbers or the

NOTE Confidence: 0.80761206

14042738-73db-452d-a2c4-5d0412a0f6ad
00:30:17.394 --> 00:30:23.722
input from the user. So when we
say that the

00:30:23.722 --> 00:30:28.694
input from the user should be
interpreted as a decimal number.

c0ffc8b0-e080-4c0e-ad8d-18dd82982c15
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:34.864
Or when we say here, printf,
%d + %d, it means

2626225e-8d59-48db-bb51-c3bddc3713a6
00:30:34.864 --> 00:30:37.720
that we are going to add two

65edff94-cf8d-46bf-afd5-d477be84ad25
00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:01.470
That's pretty much a simple as

So we say

so it's working properly. But

43970fb1-1c9b-4e9a-8e9f-87d85d5f0f74
00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.908
Is a 5 digit number. All the
digits are 9 plus 1.

93e60ac8-7ed8-4cef-801a-cf4c8624b738
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:29.006
And it's still 
seems that it's working very

3305d172-c751-4608-afa0-58c60ff2792d
00:37:29.006 --> 00:37:31.986
good. So let's put another
big number, for instance.

fcba25b7-611b-494c-b458-3f005f09c0d8
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.808
This number plus 1.

65ba98eb-a208-42ff-89bd-f9da6aff53e0
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:42.801
So now you see that, uh, even
this simple problem cannot.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.967
This program cannot solve
adding two big numbers. Can

you see my screen?

7e5ac1db-e656-49c4-bbc7-e572d9b7dc1a

So let me yeah here, as you can

00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:01.800

to send these two numbers. I

b95aaf79-aade-4932-b2e9-488208ef31ca
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:07.452
mean, the result would be one

that minus some incorrect number

e6699ec2-e03f-4dcc-ab28-61a7d33c1f31
00:38:13.104 --> 00:38:19.227
and then plus one and then we
see in negative number and it's

ff39248c-0869-429e-be21-c0fb8f095f38
00:38:19.227 --> 00:38:22.053
this kind of strange number.

c61e03f0-4c22-45ff-ba4d-b103b30e8b5d

What's the problem?

Yes, integer overflow.

using integer using long

370ce03e-4d77-478f-8ad6-415f1d1fbba5
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:11.450
You're absolutely right. But the
thing is, this knowledge comes

NOTE Confidence: 0.8643233

2c4d52cb-cdc8-44b4-970c-f286033268e6
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:16.322
from the knowing the C language
or knowing how to store the

e15674ea-7d40-4524-9da0-8e4c7dacf05f
00:39:16.322 --> 00:39:18.352
numbers in the computer system.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:24.534
So I'm saying even if you store,
even if you use the long

fad5b07d-5653-4614-a773-42607092c1b0

limitation to input numbers in
order to store the numbers.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:39.539
So all of you are right, so we
can change

74a08f41-1225-45c8-bde8-874dc0cb6c37
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:46.142

long int into long long int. But
again there's a limit to the

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:59.409
Another extreme thing is that instead of just using the

the limitation of the C language
in storing the numbers.

713e5a65-27ac-430f-99ed-111a8c1aab75
00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.993
Let's kill the problem by
writing our own addition.

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:53.274
 From the primary school, we know how to add two numbers,

a7458e5a-b9b3-40d7-894d-0be1dd98a300
00:40:53.274 --> 00:40:54.495
for instance 958

cad959c5-e929-4a49-8a7e-4bb51380d0f7
00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.820
plus for instance 13. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.86374336

30937ce4-db77-4b90-8a1c-db20b4a48856
00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:06.750
So we say that we added
each digit by each other

NOTE Confidence: 0.86374336

bffcaab1-7bc8-47b2-8643-826482166df1
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.830
from the less significant
position to the most

1faaafc2-553e-41fa-bb8b-a90c75f2ddea
00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:14.065
significant position. So from
this side to that side, so 8

NOTE Confidence: 0.86374336

96bce3e0-31f4-450a-8bed-15e99473110a
00:41:14.065 --> 00:41:20.225
+ 3 is 11, so you have to put
11 here, but now we

ce41145d-fad4-4199-9451-63847a12280f
00:41:20.225 --> 00:41:24.845
have to put just one #1
digit. So then we divide

NOTE Confidence: 0.86374336

bf22969e-ec3c-4aad-9c0b-b360985e8cd1
00:41:24.845 --> 00:41:26.770
11 by 10. One. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.9288614

a87834a2-8c58-4776-bfc0-bea3f2ae5abf
00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.777
So we put the remainder in the

6b059d9f-d88e-4c2a-b302-e302f6506e1a
00:41:31.777 --> 00:41:39.412
 result. And this is the carry. So we put this carry to the 

NOTE Confidence: 0.886919

d79668fc-ef26-49b7-9159-c6b1d7eb8716
00:41:39.412 --> 00:41:44.434
next position. So then
we would have

2a817daa-e130-4e12-ac25-d406cd30a5fc
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:52.565
 1 here and the carry goes here and then 1 + 5 = 6 and then 7 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8686598

056ec45d-2e0c-4441-b5a5-65cf0e848691
00:41:52.565 --> 00:41:58.515
and 9 + 0 is 9, so this is
the basic algorithm which is

98f5edd5-2af2-4a4b-9a2c-92345ffaf95a
00:41:58.515 --> 00:42:03.190

fb37a6f5-dd9e-41f4-904c-02e271fdac59
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:08.715
now we have we can write our own
addition instead of just

be6cc115-fde0-474e-ad2f-9951117aed2e

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:17.968
And then it stores the number as

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:37.566

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:50.750

adding two very large numbers.

thing is, Travis says that yes,

00:52:20.684 --> 00:52:25.948
how large is 2 numbers

a limit and that limit is the
memory of our computer system.

00:52:56.580 --> 00:53:00.630
then you approach another
solution to solve the adding of

cd03bb92-e6a0-44d4-ac40-c8ec504755fe

00:53:30.451 --> 00:53:35.192
one problem is that it doesn't
actually solve the adding of two

Also this program doesn't add

00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:39.220
Uh, two n means 2 * 10 becomes 20 steps. Or if "n" is equal to,

00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:46.060
let's put it here. "n" is equal to 10, so 2 * n is 20 steps.

2dd49474-d3cc-4eb1-8019-fb64d5bea30f

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:41.550
Because it has 50,000 lines and

And then come here when you're

go here and do the paste.

1ced6c5d-957b-462b-9ffd-c93cd49e1cbf
01:01:34.137 --> 01:01:35.509
now the second number.

caf486cd-5120-4df5-abfa-2e830209eb83
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:46.540
And then execute this sum.

4def376a-e348-4036-943e-3a2c19d74977
01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:52.136
As you can see, this is the
result right away after running

76913c7d-97c7-4ddf-94fe-51ce3b80dfb0
01:01:52.136 --> 01:01:56.595
the program and the last digit
is 8, because 9 + 9 becomes

a9d14534-33bb-4798-abbc-089970065e59
01:01:56.595 --> 01:02:01.397
eight goes to carry 9 + 9 eight
plus the carry, 19 nine and etc.

1a5dccbd-7aa5-4d79-bdc7-e83e463480a7
01:02:01.397 --> 01:02:06.885
So the 1st digit is 1, which if
you scroll up we can see the 1st

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:13.848
So that's a huge number, so
we cannot see the first of

the last #8, but the time is

f6e2dc38-cc9c-41a4-acc0-f7cd630db46d
01:02:18.905 --> 01:02:23.184
still zero. It means that
it's very slow.

01:03:05.042 --> 01:03:08.498

The correct answer is n and the

01:03:12.075 --> 01:03:18.646
reason is, as you can see, at the 
first step we do one sum

NOTE Confidence: 0.87362546

44f525c0-a35d-46f4-ab7d-d9cad1d6b946
01:03:18.646 --> 01:03:20.556
and then second step another

14292d6c-c73d-4938-a81c-5e4375fb57f2
01:03:20.556 --> 01:03:27.156

we increase the i to the end

9f45b88a-c9c9-4ad7-9e5a-2e1ccfcf96c4
01:03:27.156 --> 01:03:33.186
of the array, so we do all this
summation. So when we are at the

191ba8c2-79c4-4f02-88d4-7993b19bd1a4
01:03:33.186 --> 01:03:37.206

446a5fa9-8734-4e37-9d7d-6f8f518392c0
01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:42.464
We are when we are in this position, N minus one. The

01:03:42.464 --> 01:03:46.902
 position N minus 1, zero to N minus one. So N steps we are

38dd9cdc-66f0-4800-807f-0c03ed0f575b
01:03:46.902 --> 01:03:48.170
done with the summation.

cb756037-6e3e-4f84-93cd-1b54005aa142
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:53.418
So also we have another carry
here, so we do another, for

ba07d075-c9a8-4383-992d-9a995475fa85
01:03:53.418 --> 01:03:59.103
instance sum, so it becomes N minus
1 + 1. So in general we end with

bd1f0c0d-c7ac-47d5-9c00-cad69dcd68ac
01:03:59.103 --> 01:04:03.272
any step. We are done with the

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:09.824
So that's the correct answer.
But again, even for big

1d328f0d-aeac-4364-9eb6-d8128f7e35e7
01:04:09.824 --> 01:04:14.360
number of N, the program
actually slows down gradually.

01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:50.076

01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:00.526
And then we limit the user. We
didn't do that, but you

there are still some problems.

add to big numbers.

69623dea-0fc8-4c48-ae46-67a7bb0074a8
01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:28.828
And the timing is very fast as
we see the number of steps is

980d4265-8c42-4d2d-9352-eafca1d5343d
01:05:28.828 --> 01:05:30.463
the number of digits n

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.410
OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8868608

496f3ab7-1f4f-49f5-be01-ad5b2baa066e
01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.780
And then now I just wanted
to show you that

43f0acd9-6934-40e5-aeb2-a24b226203d8
01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:52.930
If I reiterate this addition,
this I mean 250K digits.

NOTE Confidence: 0.935134

20e42404-e9af-4ab0-ad50-d5c640874d33
01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.858
For one time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9252323

8e550ecf-307e-4bdb-a3f0-35390fa409f8
01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:00.275
It's very fast, but if I run
this for 100 times.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609369

0c1679ea-0b27-4df5-898e-82acbe67e09d
01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:05.250
And the application is for
instance for matrix addition.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609369

40b5b61f-2204-4a17-ae9c-115c36d3ed31
01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:10.658
If you have two matrix,
each one has a dimension 10 by

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609369

14d5f46d-b534-4be4-aaae-a7cd34007e13
01:06:10.658 --> 01:06:16.066
10 and if you wanted to do the
addition, it becomes 100 times

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609369

1eb126f7-e1ba-46b2-ab1c-bfcbe2b7867b
01:06:16.066 --> 01:06:20.642
addition. So if you wanted to addition of two matrices with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609369

a43c5ec8-55a7-4630-9c60-9b29e20e5d8a
01:06:20.642 --> 01:06:25.634
hundred elements, so we have to
do this summation instead of 1

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609369

3e08cfdd-4346-4761-9da3-59a76759c61d
01:06:25.634 --> 01:06:30.210
time 100 times. So if we
increase the iteration, this is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609369

873e596a-8674-46e1-94b0-6b234ce18c8b
01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:31.874
the program I did.

49ed6e68-7f63-4372-9912-58ae608e0524
01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:37.836
To show you that if the number
of additions for this program

555a9c4b-7d56-4980-92a4-375a5e6358fb
01:06:37.836 --> 01:06:43.560
increases. From 100  to 1000,
the running time increases too

NOTE Confidence: 0.87845737

e9776004-06f2-4763-b0e8-6ff89a7fda03
01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:48.260
linearly, so if you do the
additional 50K numbers 400,000

NOTE Confidence: 0.87845737

c1ab8510-d6b2-4d9c-93fe-c8c17a00f2fc
01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:53.900
for 1000 times, it becomes 2
seconds and as I said, the

NOTE Confidence: 0.87845737

34e6993c-5438-4aba-b5ca-ff6831c13387
01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:55.310
application is for matrix

a8fbc9f4-c106-4caf-9fba-d9afc0a9e3e9
01:06:55.310 --> 01:07:00.695
summation. So again, we need
to know how to make it fast

NOTE Confidence: 0.90867835

8fe1c46c-a1ed-46e0-aff0-807ee6f70300
01:07:00.695 --> 01:07:04.645
and the knowledge we need is
the knowledge from computer

f1930400-9a66-453e-8842-51b7114f2c63
01:07:04.645 --> 01:07:08.595
systems. If we know how the
computer system is working

01:07:08.595 --> 01:07:12.940
inside, we can come up with
the program that runs faster

NOTE Confidence: 0.90867835

b9b2b1ad-7b7c-4671-8ef2-f1c6e0fcf63d
01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.520
and lowers down this

f8960d96-083a-4a46-831b-bcb5ed1eaaa2
01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:21.036
Linear I mean increase of the
time to just a little bit slow.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8490203

cd849112-48aa-4c01-b281-209fac83f538
01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:25.740
I mean the speed becomes a
little bit lower and the program

NOTE Confidence: 0.8490203

4a83f7f5-cb2a-402a-829c-9e4126862f03
01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.916
actually runs faster.

01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:34.446
So I put this example to
just to show you that

machine, so you have to know
basics of the machine

01:11:49.266 --> 01:11:53.366
learning objectives. Basically,
in this document it says.

eb4b81da-36ce-4c5a-9cb9-dc4a702a5b6d
01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:58.024
For a successful student
after passing this course,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8218351

fa3088a0-6ac1-4c30-a393-bdb1c38584e2
01:11:58.024 --> 01:12:02.237
What's the knowledge or ability
of these students? So here I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8218351

25025d55-407f-46aa-ae45-8281f8312c76
01:12:02.237 --> 01:12:06.450
just opened this document. Just
this. Just a PDF document. You

8d63e657-bc46-4bee-b509-93ea8348386a
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:08.748
can have it in the blackboard.

26782d7e-9ca5-4b83-9bc1-289b9c2eee00
01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:15.114
And I just wanted to just show
you some very important details

cff689be-ca04-4c87-9efa-4f6d7c7e61db
01:12:15.114 --> 01:12:19.866
of that. So a successful student
actually, after passing this

NOTE Confidence: 0.86179715

7df1fc76-cfd2-4b0f-bca8-fe1b291d4b02
01:12:19.866 --> 01:12:23.619
course, has the ability to
analyze digital circuits.

037a01fb-36cb-4973-a634-bbdbf8299b87
01:12:23.619 --> 01:12:28.623
Most importantly, the CPU and
also to design a new circuit. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.86179715

83512719-1efa-4f8c-bc82-06930a6b10d8
01:12:28.623 --> 01:12:34.044
if we give you some problem, you
are able to design in digital

NOTE Confidence: 0.86179715

03e91283-779a-4bd9-9db7-c6afbf2ef040
01:12:34.044 --> 01:12:38.214
circuits and also you can
explain how a computer system

05035555-ecbd-42d5-80dc-eeb685eeefed
01:12:38.214 --> 01:12:43.218
works. But one thing is that
here in this course we don't

a9668c8a-2855-481d-9522-6928efdecf57
01:12:43.218 --> 01:12:49.056
teach you how to build a digital
circuits or how to build a CPU.

7a7435e6-dd68-474c-aa8a-f89a83582bc3
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:54.254
So in terms of the physical
sense, you can design the CPU in

NOTE Confidence: 0.860974

a02a5ee8-2be6-4655-9b25-565511b3acd5
01:12:54.254 --> 01:12:59.406
with a pen and a paper, but you cannot build it.

b1f00bb1-cb86-4771-a6f2-c74ddc6b717e
01:12:59.406 --> 01:13:03.822
As I said, you can take advanced
courses in order to gain

knowledge in building a CPU or
digital circuits, but here you

fde3f7b1-d4f6-4839-b404-1bf54eab8944
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:09.710
only can analyze and design.

01:13:41.064 --> 01:13:45.345
four pages. Uh, the version
right now in the blackboard is

80285d13-8ba9-45fd-9fbf-9d4d1cf0bf76
01:13:45.345 --> 01:13:48.495
version one. If we change this
document later within the

01:13:48.495 --> 01:13:52.275
course, I'm going to change the
version. So when you open the

is changing, it means that there

01:13:56.055 --> 01:13:59.835
is a little bit of change to the
document, so the next version

031ebc3d-da8f-4c48-8886-009c316ff319
01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:04.245
 going to be for instance 1.1, if it is a minor change. If there's

1b8814ac-abcb-44eb-b7ae-9520e8a41cc9
01:14:04.245 --> 01:14:07.395
a huge change, it becomes
version 2 or version 3.
