00:04:45.736 --> 00:04:49.732

In another perspective, the

1ee4d39c-bf9b-417e-bbe7-c0f797f9270d
00:15:17.081 --> 00:15:21.734
just without knowing any

00:15:21.734 --> 00:15:27.938
my computer system. So basically
I can create a new program, let

bb5fc871-a2e2-4884-aee5-934f6a854272
00:15:27.938 --> 00:15:32.694

fec5fb18-700e-4858-8460-cdd3a29aa1e9
00:15:32.694 --> 00:15:36.467
I'll explain that you are going
to have some lab assignments

00:15:36.467 --> 00:15:40.926
that you have to do in the C
language. Our default is the

c1409f8b-b155-4ce7-9ec7-4155515dcdf1

eclipse environment, but you can
use any programming environment

927eb971-93ea-4e08-a0b3-400e6a3948e4
00:15:44.013 --> 00:15:46.071

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:16.583
And, uh, that's it pretty much
it. So this is the most simplest

NOTE Confidence: 0.8145354

77c8efe2-8df0-4a5e-a5b9-dbf254f3264b
00:16:16.583 --> 00:16:20.993
program in C language. So let me
just zoom in.

4d044347-9995-4df5-9c33-83413fdaaeac
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.436
Oh sorry, how can
I zoom in Eclipse?

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.776
So I believe you can see
my code now.

1fd17e78-8fc9-413c-bf4c-0b120531bf27
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:41.919
So I'm going to just write the
most simplest program to add 2

NOTE Confidence: 0.8686911

84c97608-e7b4-4866-8244-ead122fe83c9
00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:45.825
integers. So I write
a function called at.

c36f2ecd-32d6-4e50-bf53-eff99e65fef3
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:51.130
Which accept two integers A&B.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.314
And basically it returns a class

acbb6f97-2aba-4476-a607-4ee2b8adc246
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.468
And then I'm going to just.

edc6cce4-c258-437a-89ca-8787ffc2ef7a
00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.779

00:17:14.852 --> 00:17:21.476
this is one of the most simplest
problem, But this problem, I

df41a74b-fd4c-43b6-81d4-cd56431ceedd
00:17:21.476 --> 00:17:28.100
mean, was among the first main
problem in human history. How to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8052897

45099273-e337-4c95-90b4-17eeec21a9ae
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.756
add 2 numbers?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7812239

223adb8e-c56a-4839-bc31-7dab80f1c0f2
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:37.958
Now why we need numbers and why
we need to add numbers etc. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.7812239

4b228001-9d71-4dc4-a97a-9b220f10b3f9
00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.126
enter an integer number.

d1cc1865-1059-4fcd-b9c3-6c21dcdfc799
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:49.122
And then I just scan if ask the
user to put any decimal number.

NOTE Confidence: 0.812759

fc27cf79-e2a1-4f65-aa3a-bf814b45e162
00:17:49.122 --> 00:17:55.114
So we need a variable here. So I
define a variable in one, also

NOTE Confidence: 0.812759

72ac83b2-603a-41ea-8348-08e6e5ddde0e
00:17:55.114 --> 00:18:00.250
another number and two. I just
wanted to store the results of

e3eb91e7-1fb5-452a-a389-10df847e8c41
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:06.242
the addition in some. So here I
ask mean number and then I store

NOTE Confidence: 0.812759

14c8764e-f839-44bb-a3d1-5cca0771fc4c
00:18:06.242 --> 00:18:07.954

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.840
So so far you need. You see that
there is no need to know where

a1923b0a-f34e-40e3-b0e4-dba516378a63
00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.528
these variables are stored in
the computer machine.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.140
So and then I.

7dce8306-a715-465d-b506-766e4a8b08ca
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.598
Ask the user for another input.

then I called the function at.

e66df982-73bd-4dbc-b330-d83721257d26

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:44.162
And then later I just wanted
to print your result in the

just to be consistent with all

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:59.530
So one thing is that let's save

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:05.250
it. And then build the program.
So in the here you in the bottom

of the page you can see that
it's built successfully and then

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.030
we can run the program.

79046e1b-6167-4fe9-b0b7-d0dd4cdadf2c
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.190
OK, now will you sad.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:25.416
I'm here. So in eclipse you have
to say that this is a local

here's the output. As you can

00:20:29.952 --> 00:20:34.110
see here, there's a bug in
Eclipse. It doesn't print out

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:39.024
the input because it caches or a
buffers the output. So just to

85d685bb-a0ed-4bb5-b3a5-08dd9ff07e2f
00:20:39.024 --> 00:20:43.560
solve this problem, I just end
the program. There is a command

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:53.650

that the standard output the

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:58.590
buffering must be null and I got
to not buffer the output. So

27bdbf74-e4de-4201-a345-209003ed507e
00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:03.530
this is because of the Eclipse
park, so you might not need this

ad958ba6-afbb-4f53-8877-185a8868b75a
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:07.330
for other environments. One
thing is that in eclipse you

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.890

037848bb-dfa2-46bf-8cc8-4f3bacb3d03e
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.855

And then we put all this
together to build a

you as a student and me as the

00:44:06.778 --> 00:44:12.542
student who wants to pass the
course. So basically we have

2a57cdad-b905-4d82-8362-616a14316418
00:44:12.542 --> 00:44:17.782

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:24.489
30% so these are I mean in the

1a6fe5ce-70b1-45cb-b343-ca000b042bd7
00:44:24.489 --> 00:44:29.728
are take home exam so basically
I released exams and you go home

3a958d24-6425-46eb-87d3-68196fd088d7
00:44:29.728 --> 00:44:34.967
and solve the problem. So this
is open book open source I mean

7bbd99bb-2566-48ad-992b-5887d87eba27
00:44:34.967 --> 00:44:39.803
exam but these take home exams
are timed meaning that when you

787b3869-d1c3-4194-a0cc-47643bcb90ea
00:44:39.803 --> 00:44:45.042
open the exam and you have a

00:44:45.042 --> 00:44:49.878
usually about two or three hours
limit I put on the exams.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682632

47a33c1f-5eee-4397-b9c6-60dfeba2f1fc
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:54.858
So although the whole day, for
instance, I release the exam on

97ae1d89-f8a5-4d61-a487-0d8d76634d64
00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:59.720
April, for instance 20 and you
have the whole day to do the

4b8f0a31-736d-4086-b064-f486d80301dd
00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:04.582
exam. But when you open the exam
you have a limited time to

64c95c50-abe9-4e58-8594-ab079bfc007d
00:45:04.582 --> 00:45:07.948
finish it, so it's called timed
take home exam.

NOTE Confidence: 0.835301

9cb1ecdb-59b5-4c81-af22-916c35809a0e
00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:13.270

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:16.420
types of exams are you are
you're going to have?

805b8963-7bd0-4969-9e89-b35c5511109f
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.100
And based on a weekly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85476893

46a8a303-fe56-4fca-8ee5-eaedc0252fa9
00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:26.689
Lectures and weekly I mean
practices. We have two types of

0feaa251-0f96-42c9-a148-99d07cd347fa
00:45:26.689 --> 00:45:30.550
assignments, lecture assignments
and lab assignments, so we are

fee1cb63-e80c-434f-a58c-d1d6a57a2a0c
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:35.269
going to have 10 of each 10
labs, 10 lectures. Lecture

NOTE Confidence: 0.85476893

c0859055-8e79-47e4-ae79-f1914a54afe5
00:45:35.269 --> 00:45:39.130
assignments are those
assignments that is based on the

caae5d11-c236-4184-aa6e-1f264d88cb05
00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:43.849
I mean mathematical proof or I
mean, some exercises that you

NOTE Confidence: 0.85476893

05fca475-c888-4dd8-920f-532cc4e3029b
00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:49.855
can solve by pen and paper. So
for instance, I ask you how we

NOTE Confidence: 0.85476893

737429d2-2c0b-4ffd-8dea-361f823350de
00:45:49.855 --> 00:45:52.000
represent the number 10 in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8518604

335ff08b-a265-4d32-bd06-660c3eb9db45
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.550
decimal system. When we wanted
to convert it to binary system

NOTE Confidence: 0.8518604

3009990d-1085-47f1-bf0d-75d6cb8b3276
00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:00.180
or to hexadecimal system or in
another system. So these are

NOTE Confidence: 0.8518604

d071e867-f7ce-4f74-a610-07f9be774957
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:04.470
just a problem that you have
to solve it by pen and paper.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8518604

76bb6de2-19ce-43b3-954d-932abc53485b
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:08.760
So then you have to take a
snapshot of your paper. I mean

NOTE Confidence: 0.8518604

88c2ebad-6355-4418-80d9-542cbae25273
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.730
your assignment and then
upload it to the blackboard.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8418282

6897d866-73b4-44e9-b1a3-1d25f2091285
00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:17.448
Uh, there would be a manual for
that, so in that manual the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8418282

5132c7db-c2dd-4447-8acb-f048dd253b16
00:46:17.448 --> 00:46:21.480
question is gonna be in that
manual. And also usually I put

NOTE Confidence: 0.8418282

0abbcf23-ae9d-4f73-a9da-6333bf6b06d2
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:26.184
10 or 12 questions about you are
able to just select two or three

NOTE Confidence: 0.8418282

d91b26db-d0e9-447f-802e-df32619b1e22
00:46:26.184 --> 00:46:29.544
of them based on your
preference. So basically I say

NOTE Confidence: 0.8418282

935b9435-f23f-4af8-a4d3-984bbd89925e
00:46:29.544 --> 00:46:32.904
that select two of these
questions and answer them and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8418282

6a57a79b-2e5f-4789-accc-5fb97555ce7d
00:46:32.904 --> 00:46:36.600
upload your answer to the
blackboard. So these are type of

c7590a58-0a25-4473-8f34-2dd95a9a256d
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.608
the lecture assignments.

1c3c8587-0afd-46c1-b9e0-d4c94ba73ff1
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:41.300
For the lab assignments, the

manual, so in the lab
assignments, these are the

7095e8cc-520b-4b4e-8fb7-3e3d184b08dc
00:46:44.063 --> 00:46:47.133
programming assignments, so
you have to write program in C

3b655880-4bb2-4a22-980f-6b7f813c6820
00:46:47.133 --> 00:46:47.747
or C++.

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:53.720
Like as I did today, um,
actually the first lab is

5309dd32-370c-4973-916c-7683de6db631
00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.620
already uploaded in the

00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:03.080
look. Will look at it. I mean,
right now as an example and we

3a3e9df2-86fc-43d3-b212-a244c65fe0af
00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.420
are going to have 14 weeks.

5f3658ff-8275-454a-a58c-ef7db3033b00
00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:10.150
There is no lab for this week.
The labs they both assignments

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:13.945
so there is no assignments for
the first week. The assignments

b26bdf4c-e263-482f-96ea-cb7620ed0bca
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:21.278

00:47:21.278 --> 00:47:24.866
assignments in the last two

069b1268-3de2-4088-a472-1125b4670cfd
00:47:24.866 --> 00:47:26.959

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:38.609
Um so in total we're going to
have 10 labs, 10 lectures, each

61147570-fdb3-4801-9841-0cc4494617a2

ffd73b94-53a1-47a5-af79-3ad9eef237f1
00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:46.169

b07c9621-b8be-418b-a091-0569d1e21ce3
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:10.740
question, but you don't obtain
any bonus points. I highly

665b5de2-6c4b-47da-ab2e-4cb819e352a5
00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.935
suggest you you put your

for that. First of all, you

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:21.390

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:25.295
students that have the solution
to your question, so they may

8fb79394-5fc9-43e4-901b-27cc0cfbfc61
00:48:25.295 --> 00:48:28.845
answer your question much more
faster or better. Also, there

c36031f3-ffed-442f-91ff-197fc822dcfd
00:48:28.845 --> 00:48:32.395
might be other students that
have the same question, so

b052a101-a042-43eb-ac23-d8e1172e0202
00:48:37.684 --> 00:48:39.180

00:49:59.592 --> 00:50:04.550
question. I understand that why
we start the labs from the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8264074

784ddc6e-f7c4-4696-818e-06d70e8378fc
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:08.846
number 2. The reason is that we
have a. I synchronize the

a1a2b72f-cc94-4e26-ab46-232d7d4a85b1
00:50:08.846 --> 00:50:13.500
numbers at the ID for the lab

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:18.512
So we are at the lab for the
second week is called Lab 02.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8264074

8f0000f1-cee4-475e-be61-bdf4ff777750
00:50:18.512 --> 00:50:23.166
The lecture for the 2nd way is
02, so the number actually shows

8ef7082d-4fff-4f01-aefd-5a8062893938
00:50:23.166 --> 00:50:28.536
the week number. So as a result
there is no lab 7 because Lab 7

dad205e3-ca0e-4684-a15e-fc7425cd2a45
00:50:28.536 --> 00:50:32.116

01:09:15.615 --> 01:09:19.762
or come up with your own
solution. Sometimes in the exams

28f4cc2f-3d22-431d-bb1d-f763403683fc
01:09:19.762 --> 01:09:23.909
or in the assignments. This
student says that this is the

01:09:23.909 --> 01:09:28.433
correct solution, but my idea of
solution is this an sometimes I

01:09:32.203 --> 01:09:38.250

01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:43.480

d8812ad4-d740-485a-bf77-c53250ce7316
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:58.935

5ad0d6da-244c-4e56-9b90-ff8283a19c72
01:10:57.390 --> 01:11:01.686
On Tuesday we cover some part of

97cac411-a842-48e6-8052-d5e3cfc12e2f

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:23.882

c11ec6ed-1533-46f2-b9fe-158dde8e0a49
01:11:23.882 --> 01:11:28.400
questions. And one thing is that
usually for the lecture

NOTE Confidence: 0.8588783

a6f38a2a-9396-43ab-ad46-dcee85b7e3fe
01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.800

ae337df1-eb70-437d-addf-b45e015a2eaa
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.400

01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:55.006

fc806cae-c35d-47c6-935e-21a56dba858e
01:11:55.006 --> 01:11:58.559
not mandatory, but we released
the recording for the labs as

5aac518d-5bdb-4f33-bd4c-8c5855efc170
01:11:58.559 --> 01:12:03.081
well. So we record the labs too.
And then we release it. If at

01:12:03.081 --> 01:12:06.957
least one student at I mean
attending labs. So if you have

4e4f2a92-9f12-43f6-9dc5-0e965e094935
01:12:06.957 --> 01:12:10.833

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:31.026
Um? One thing is that if you are
not able to submit the black so

c9d88a5a-8586-45cc-8c99-beae39dc83db
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:46.470
And then you explain you take a
snapshot of the problem from the

fd0993dd-f071-4bce-bd00-dd82e0d38bfc
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:50.790
blackboard and then you explain
that this is the reason that I

16aaeedf-e329-4100-aa6b-eb02033ce830
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:54.750
didn't submit to the blackboard
and but The thing is that

582381b9-44c5-432f-a3d2-cb9261f0f288
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:59.070
finally they gonna ask you to
submit it to the blackboard. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.8614136

dd29ba35-cdf4-40b6-8ccf-3852f261a4a9
01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:03.390
sending email it just for you
just to bypass the deadline. So

133630e9-1e49-4add-8373-9f87a6984999
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:07.350
after after the blackboard
becomes OK. So you have to again

1ca94fa3-58b6-43bd-8b90-e2e742d69030
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:11.670

01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:15.916

can provide some justification

a859fcc4-e616-45cf-b8ed-426646e24994
01:13:15.916 --> 01:13:19.399
