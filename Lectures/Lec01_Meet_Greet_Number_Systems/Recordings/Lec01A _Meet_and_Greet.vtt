00:44:36.238 --> 00:44:38.966
 I will explain, I mean in few next slides.

cbd92607-bc48-41d9-80cb-c48a965b298d
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.310
So.

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.018
OK, go ahead Maria. So what's the question?

1566ef2a-cd9d-4374-92bc-d6376a8bf560
00:44:54.980 --> 00:45:02.270
Ah. Oh, the set buffer again.

cfa986ea-cedc-4765-9a0b-a15fc995e265
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:05.050
The short answer is that setting the

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:07.930
buffer off mean that, so let me back to.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.478
The program here.

62b54fb1-27e8-4255-bfdb-56b507c2cd04
00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:17.496
It means that it turn off the buffering,

2779b7b5-c912-44bf-a296-333d6a00eeab
00:45:17.496 --> 00:45:19.903
so you would ask me what is

b2033a87-32be-48d4-9521-df6207e4259b
00:45:19.903 --> 00:45:22.213
buffering and I will tell you that.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.635
This course and the next course is

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:28.549
So this is a good question if

00:45:28.549 --> 00:45:30.301

dd4f57c8-e2ca-4daa-b2f7-db45a3f805f2
00:45:31.931 --> 00:45:34.066
you just want to write a program,

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.618
you won't know what is the problem

570f446f-992e-4bbe-bacc-acc28de81d2d

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.000
So the short answer is that

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.090

Basically it, uh,

c56188ed-a3ae-4c34-83ed-201ecce9f62a
00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:01.260
instead of just outputting the

f57c04bb-52d5-4e2f-a3be-ec2e4449966a
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.304
each character into the monitor or

00:46:07.352 --> 00:46:10.480
It waits up until a certain amount

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.115

00:46:13.115 --> 00:46:16.680

040b3f37-67dc-4005-9bd4-0eeaa6fb93cd
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:18.878
And this is because of the efficiency.

7ffa19e0-0f41-412d-93d1-e2c0ff0dbfe0
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.677
if you do it character by character,

3ae968bb-3867-432f-aca5-9867f04ef29e
00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:27.600
it takes a lot of.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.990
What happens is that the computer

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:35.520
system waits up until, for instance,

00:46:38.801 --> 00:46:42.233
then in one round it outputs the character.
