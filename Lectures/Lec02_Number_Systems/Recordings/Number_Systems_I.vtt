00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:36.010
kilometre And then the earth
diameter is 13,000.

NOTE Confidence: 0.849494874477386

059c3e61-6233-42ae-9feb-681c8f66a96e
00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:43.558
So because the unit is Earth,
so you have to simply divide

NOTE Confidence: 0.849494874477386

9e1935de-27d7-463b-acc3-e5effb09b425
00:26:43.558 --> 00:26:46.312

aaa05198-a3be-4760-9a39-08135b1bcc11
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:07.546
So how many earth we have to
pass? So the correct answer

5a8472a3-ba5e-446e-b6ed-9f520faee3f7
00:27:07.546 --> 00:27:13.175
gonna be the 12,000. So we need
12,000 Earth to pass to reach

And each one can be represented
by the symbol I. So we need to

Most of you actually put the

00:27:51.393 --> 00:27:56.450
characters. So how many papers
do you need to represent the

have, you can write 3000 I so.

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:18.426
It's very simple. So
basically you just divide

00:28:18.426 --> 00:28:23.910
2000 by 3000, so the correct

c816788a-0502-4610-a7de-8591078cf83e
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:29.851
said 89. So you see that this
let me back to these slides.

one distance, you need 4 pages

and you have to fill the whole 4
pages by 1.

the reason was that they didn't

00:31:52.448 --> 00:31:57.524
explore this more. If you are
interested. So this is my number

00:31:57.524 --> 00:32:02.177
system in my number system I
have four symbols or digits.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.094
I can represent zero of Unit
0 and then one the same as

00:32:07.094 --> 00:32:11.488
the honor system. One is the
same, but for two. I have a

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.808
So let's see how this
number system works.

b8cf5ffc-bb06-4fde-b473-122d47be739f
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.359
If I'm staying at moon, the
distance is 0.

1162c0cd-7f72-4f73-bc8a-19fd049da146
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.440
For now, so zero.

dc8ea859-8362-4cea-a42f-f8ebbd9ddde5
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:32.155
And then one minutes to unit 3
unit and then if you go to the

next step after three there is
no symbol in my system to

00:32:41.073 --> 00:32:44.503
with an algorithm to represent
the next step after free.

87d56291-3bd1-453d-badb-f11ad45af11e
00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:50.146
I can say that I cannot
represent this distance by three

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:00.850
have to come up with reusing

6818f2c0-598d-416b-a13e-bb7a12a96a34

e2228f3f-7996-469c-acb5-167ce6ae4e1e
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.768
And this is my algorithm, so
any numbering system has an

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:26.113
So I'll start with counting from
00 distance 123. Now if I want

9f27e5b5-2e60-4cf1-9006-cf4b1e6fd98c
00:33:26.113 --> 00:33:32.106
to go to next unit, basically I
introduce a new position to the

63764b10-785d-4d51-a6c8-6fcb00d0bccd
00:33:32.106 --> 00:33:35.794
left. So I add a new position to

ad775ade-4c36-4544-967e-2fa379b233f8
00:33:35.794 --> 00:33:42.690
the left. To keep track of
what we've done so far, and then

a32bba3c-85db-4a1b-aa9e-abaf209a8c50
00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:48.540
I start counting again from
zero. So four is 3 so far, plus

b65686cd-e92e-4313-85e6-17bf4ae45679
00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:56.480
is 4. Five is 0 +
1 and then 6.

40ad8015-47d7-440b-b6eb-d34c46c17dd5
00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.422
And then seven. So seven is

ea0288cf-9a1c-45ae-bb60-945faf099a94
00:34:00.422 --> 00:34:06.332

3 which becomes 7.

b4653e67-b8f8-41af-a60b-6e76e22c40ac
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.479
You could say that just sounded
digits plus the number of

00:34:10.479 --> 00:34:14.427
positions minus one because we
need to know the number of new

9882c291-2538-456f-bcb9-8c073a0c5629
00:34:14.427 --> 00:34:20.953

to go to the next step so we

4d670916-4214-4108-8699-0eb7cdeb73c5
00:34:20.953 --> 00:34:25.542
cannot use 4 because there is no
symbols before, so we keep track

4a283e32-ce90-44d3-b0fd-407064ce1f6a
00:34:25.542 --> 00:34:29.778
of what we've done so far by
introducing a new position and

5939178f-2565-4146-8484-c3821a3bf654
00:34:29.778 --> 00:34:35.426
then add 0. So 3 + 3 + 0 plus
the number of new positions to

09d60e4b-1057-4e1d-a5b1-f102989ad6c0
00:34:35.426 --> 00:34:41.753
becomes 8. You can add the new
position to the right instead of

93030c27-03eb-425e-a2ef-5209c998bd7f
00:34:41.753 --> 00:34:46.949

b28c0db6-23e1-48f4-b068-04f6f9ef248e
00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:52.145
for instance 0123 new position
to the right and then 03003 in

dc4520e0-feae-4a05-81cb-174be73d56c2

this number system becomes 4.

129defdc-558a-4e64-87f7-cb94ba77b540

e24dc850-8cfc-4376-965d-44fa47306500

Which means that 3 + 3 + 0

But in my system, I assume that
I fixed the algorithm. I said

00:35:11.806 --> 00:35:14.826
that whenever I need to

165f437d-d385-4b8d-a6cf-3ffa2c775541
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:23.471
So let's continue 910 eleven, so
11 it's done. You see that with

includes the largest digit in

00:35:28.214 --> 00:35:33.670
all positions. And now we have
to go further one step further

2d57e91c-3865-49b2-af21-cc7fbb9bde2a
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:38.376
so we keep track of above the

4f236141-78bd-42a2-bcd1-8bf23034eeae
00:35:38.376 --> 00:35:40.186
any position to the left.

f63cc5e4-e0d8-4578-87cd-dcb6d6ce127e
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:48.570
So this becomes a twelve 3 + 3

058c0f3c-7e04-4ea7-a519-33ae82c806be

c036e0d4-ab7f-4354-bbfc-d736a619e372

number system with the decimal

51ceb8ca-b678-47a6-81da-673abd278c4b
00:36:06.271 --> 00:36:11.181

73f952dd-bc6a-49ad-bd05-239368b6ae0d
00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:16.978
Here you have two positions,
becomes 2 -- 1 plus the

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:29.027
For instance, here 3332 is
equal to 14 because you sum

a93dddf7-fc5c-466b-a18e-915fb0d5e332

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:40.146
So any numbering system must
come up with an algorithm that

cec92fea-8939-4f7f-91e7-1cb28053bf0b

So here's the question for you,
uh, if you assume that these are

74490e27-bc97-4905-afc1-2736824d82c4
00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:01.550
the numbers in Jose's number

3d55586c-0620-4ae2-bf2f-b26ca42f858b
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.700
decimal number? For instance the

cc9da723-fe30-4c67-abf4-ce0c52aeedff
00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:08.242

So first you have to check the

d703ef6a-e56f-4a61-8506-76f16bddbf60

00:38:00.112 --> 00:38:05.819
introduce a new position, you
have to feel to the Max. So here

81a84593-31fe-4ad6-a9be-efcc6d81381a
00:38:05.819 --> 00:38:11.087
you start at the first position
and then you introduce a new

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:22.438
So you see that this is not a

0f6a4a1b-72e8-4535-bac7-401e3b0ce6ec
00:38:22.438 --> 00:38:26.710
because when you introduce a new

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:57.060
So this is a valid
number, because, uh, when you

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:11.660
maximum digits and based on

b1abc5a8-4bcc-4ec1-bab0-abaf526644d4
00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:18.960

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:26.095
so 3. You have a 12

c117efb4-fd3d-40e0-bbb9-a9ab01c76290
00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:59.741

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:04.392
The correct answer is 1 page.
So in one page you can

6ad34bdb-8e27-41f5-b5f9-e9e9b9a488fb

represent the distance.

And most of you actually could

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:18.664
So for those that are put the
incorrect answer. So if you have

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.280
Let's back to the slide. Now
you can see that at least

bbc1d5a2-fe4e-46cf-be9c-038909b78528
00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.460
once in system can reduce

instead of just 4 pages.

b9c01cc7-b312-428f-a0e3-cf5db6247635

It's just one page you put 3333

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:52.204
And the reason is that
because I introduce new

00:44:52.204 --> 00:44:57.550
symbols, I have a two and
three. So because my system

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:12.965
So my question now is that
is it possible to improve

00:45:12.965 --> 00:45:17.408

deeb25ab-c847-46a6-ae8b-990bd1d68a1d
00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:26.370
Uh, in Jose number system
when we do counting from

sincere 0123.

543632c4-330e-468d-99f8-ca46cb14d3f7
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:35.870
Oh, why we did you divide by 4?
That's back here. Oh, this is

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.195
because of the this formula.

49550389-f9b9-48c6-bebb-5c0557f376c2
00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:42.983
So as we said, the Max
number here. The Max number

2e914713-8f88-411e-ade6-6bcac60acbce
00:45:42.983 --> 00:45:48.345

if you are given a number.

a8d5ca19-265b-4629-9025-052ceb68e156
00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:53.770
So come here if you are given a
number and you are now asked how

a31bd939-29dc-4ccf-9446-ae5b4c9bac42
00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:56.962

assume that that given number is

00:45:56.962 --> 00:46:01.897
the Max. And then you bring the
minus one to the left side

NOTE Confidence: 0.891989886760712

114b3475-8da0-4b9d-bca0-728257c79aa3

instance, when we reach the step

afe515d1-e81f-4d8b-b85e-9495e676e1a4
00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:08.650
four, we say that we keep what
we've done so far. So we did

83dc89f9-2d65-48e8-ad42-5097335c86f9
00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:14.430

for we added new position and

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:19.500
then zero to represent the next
step. OK. And also when we reach

2061f96e-cf20-4ede-9117-b9ae5252d336
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:25.740
to the 3 three if we want to go
to the next step so we keep

edda88e0-f406-4adc-917c-abf3743d6c2a

another three, so another new

465861eb-0cdc-4c56-8c48-6faae21af32a

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:45.500

that we instead of storing

So here is the math so.

f40f9635-ae32-4ff8-82f1-cd0526db4f0c
01:09:27.450 --> 01:09:31.454

We assume this is the Max, so
log Max plus one divided to the
