00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.360
OK Oh yeah, awesome. So what
we said last week was that

NOTE Confidence: 0.86862975358963

446a58f4-2a9d-473b-a712-efcf5c8b4586
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.715
we had numbering system that
could represent just numbers.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.139
And then we improve the
numbering system to have a more

NOTE Confidence: 0.86732143163681

7a943000-852f-4d28-bb35-ae353d849c44
00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.910
precise precision. So we
introduce how to represent a

NOTE Confidence: 0.875656306743622

eaef9ab4-470d-4200-9a53-8b9214783ac4
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.770
fraction part. And then we said
that we can convert any number

NOTE Confidence: 0.875656306743622

4657284b-ab80-49e8-a194-b6504ac94ec3
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.776
in any basis to any other basis.
But for doing that we have to

f220ae1c-674e-4d04-992e-a364355af0c1
00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:44.492
use the decimal system.

98a51fa2-9403-4e01-a340-3c42cda8b2fb
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.058
So if you're in base 177.

ae9a3f06-6053-440c-bc7a-a8c6f2d3bc69
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.650
And we have a number there. If
you want to convert it to base,

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.910
for instance nine, you have to
1st convert the base 7 to

decimal system and then from
decimal system to base 9. The

first part was based on the

multiply each digit to the

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.162
And then sum them together. This
way you bring it to the decimal

0be6ebe8-e998-4514-a7cf-688dbdd4e767
00:05:15.162 --> 00:05:19.606

put the remainder in the reverse

you multiply by the base, I mean

00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:45.912
and then you keep the integer
part of the result, and then you

716f97d6-cf91-4299-8b5f-19d6f72c1515
00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:50.332
continue with the remainder

00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:31.658

you just Simply put a zero in

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:02.971
Also, if you're adding two

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.609
So if you do addition as a

f452d3ce-03bb-4658-ab48-7effc9d28545
00:15:23.458 --> 00:15:26.815
an you do normal addition
because negative number plus

c26eecbd-b109-430c-a1c1-5dd6668af813

And The only exception here is
this. If you're adding a

c00479a6-a0a4-496e-8bff-eb6ac46daef4
00:15:41.814 --> 00:15:48.520
number. So it depends on
the, uh, the magnitude of the

684cd44f-85d8-4f4f-8729-2252d7f03604

is positive. If X is lower than

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.681
So basically what you do is
because this feels the second

f6ce6392-6683-41d5-8b48-6c5fb3fdb747
00:16:14.546 --> 00:16:18.456
 normal subtraction and you see whether there's the last borrow

00:16:18.456 --> 00:16:24.321

means that X was lower than Y is

f5dda832-3c5e-445c-8493-de5bc7d4b93e
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.800

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.544
If there is no last, bottom
means that X was larger than

51266afb-a014-4596-8fa2-9b0afb4cde99

because if X is larger, this

f3e217eb-78bd-4ccd-9adb-76e96c9842ee
00:23:38.655 --> 00:23:43.266

although we had addition because

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:30.752
that negative number is the 10s

ced7672d-eed6-417c-aaef-bf9c3fe61037
00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:45.433
 So the 10's complements of nine is 1, so you give not you

So you can give up eight 4 --

To do that, you have to simply
do the Two's complement of the

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:04.430
that, uh? First name is actually
minus 21. The second number is

bcd3a7de-7f59-4aff-934a-94272410d6b1
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:08.181

just simply do the tools

And then do the addition. So

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:58.518
OK, so basically next ask, do we
have to convert to base two or

Only if you have a number in
sign compliment. How do we
