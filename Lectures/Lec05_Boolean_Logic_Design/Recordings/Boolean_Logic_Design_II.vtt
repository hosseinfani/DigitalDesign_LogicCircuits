something incorrect. I made a

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.345
mistake when we I designed
the circuit, so I just wanted

bdaf9d02-6091-4026-9efc-ca12f0c705fb
00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:25.535

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.140
So, um, last week last lecture,
uh, we wanted to try to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7347526

9dbdb0a2-ee1e-48e5-8baf-17abdacb34a9
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.710
design A circuit that this was

NOTE Confidence: 0.85840046

709062b0-527d-48f2-a17b-52dc38b22579
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.372
the problem. We wanted to output
a one or we want to determine

NOTE Confidence: 0.85840046

a4ed3722-4ed6-4c9c-bce4-643f7664f596
00:05:09.372 --> 00:05:14.300
whether there is an even number
of one in the input. So I did

NOTE Confidence: 0.85840046

eb1f9cc7-2787-4cef-b05a-a4b2739fecd0
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.524
mistake. I thought that I mean
the question is this. I thought

NOTE Confidence: 0.85840046

b521ccf8-fc6a-4207-9d12-38bcdeb5b98b
00:05:18.524 --> 00:05:22.396
that the question is asking us
whether to whether the input

NOTE Confidence: 0.85840046

97e40a96-7bfa-4e8b-bef6-db68e7dcd723
00:05:22.396 --> 00:05:24.156
number is even or odd.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7947439

e97d22e4-d237-4cec-b861-6341b053574d
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.926
But the this was the question.
It says that if the number

NOTE Confidence: 0.7947439

b4907bff-eec1-4f92-88c3-abc31ee82a3c
00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:33.645
of ones is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.71158296

ea343f38-90cb-47ef-8737-33e79241a8a8
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.348
Another tricky question.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82267576

74fa2255-a149-4e86-9799-068557a65c1a
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.780
Otherwise, output 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8592278

c349700d-b654-4147-9471-07e8e80b4c58
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.064
So. Basically, as I said, you
have to create a truth table and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8592278

ab89808d-29f2-4f1c-b7b1-06e799f9b21a
00:05:48.064 --> 00:05:52.510
then the left side at the number
of inputs. So in the question

NOTE Confidence: 0.8592278

7cc9c09d-2cec-43cc-ab3b-2dfbb5e28d6f
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.956
usually they say how many input
do you have. If they don't say

NOTE Confidence: 0.8592278

c3e8bbbf-da6b-4d0d-ade0-db7e104fae97
00:05:56.956 --> 00:06:01.402
you have to come up with a
instance. If they say that the

e7ecf5b4-6b3a-4b9a-a30a-c3f394159424
00:06:01.402 --> 00:06:05.506
range of the inputs are between
for instance zero to 10, you

284667d3-e2f1-4517-97ab-27e81810f4af
00:06:05.506 --> 00:06:09.952
have to convert it to binary and
figure out how many position you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8592278

07dd01fe-9a84-4692-bb39-0d7a71fad31e
00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:12.004
need to represent the input by

NOTE Confidence: 0.88118786

119034c3-6546-46a2-bb01-3903fdb81575
00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:16.526
binary numbers. And then pick a
variable name for that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83663225

77785879-6658-4dab-b20b-0c38516f75cb
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:23.632
XYZ or ABC or whatever and then
try to come up with the output

NOTE Confidence: 0.83663225

096fbed5-e790-42bf-8480-1b595be36ae2
00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:25.364
in the right side.

0eda2a06-4a5b-42d0-b4c8-afc6cd5713d4
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.195
Also, for the right side, you
have to determine how many

NOTE Confidence: 0.87712264

e59740f5-a552-4773-b567-65c1653d1da4
00:06:30.195 --> 00:06:32.325
binary output you need for this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83424956

02d43d8b-2e1e-403b-94d6-d46ffc14699e
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.316
Determine whether we have a
number of one or not. So when

NOTE Confidence: 0.83424956

0d1af1a8-ea5a-4de9-ac68-ac4549f11ce0
00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:43.336
there is a yes or no, it means
that zero and one, so we only

NOTE Confidence: 0.83424956

d6d32cd0-2958-4e00-a6ac-0bd23e8ea5f1
00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.408
need one binary app.

NOTE Confidence: 0.894844

265c875e-b57f-4af9-b133-443dc725b925
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.697
So and then you start to fill
out the right side.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93151826

79a1416d-03b1-43fa-b233-c203a329a6d4
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.080
So.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88752174

ed51a099-3d76-425e-ab43-f00368c86e9b
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.216
In the first input, when the
input is 000 and the number of

beafc4ea-0771-4066-b486-d6a035563c18
00:06:59.216 --> 00:07:03.528
ones is 0, so zero is considered
Even so you are.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8398559

4b61b8d6-0f0e-449b-a9ec-439bc651afc2
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.596
 Possibility if X is 1 Y is 0 and Z is 0 the number of ones is odd 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8398559

c8439fa6-991d-4b37-abda-a20dc888be31
00:07:14.596 --> 00:07:17.314
because we have only one digital

NOTE Confidence: 0.9361733

6d8bce97-2f4e-4329-aff6-9ef015a4400a
00:07:17.314 --> 00:07:20.740
one. So the output is 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8690721

19a63479-a865-4584-9685-d6cf77da90a6
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:27.450
The third 1010 again the number
of ones are only one digital

NOTE Confidence: 0.8690721

f4de7020-487a-4080-89ff-0877206330e1
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.825
one. The number ones are.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7006959

fcd34c54-a691-485c-a598-acaba1acb448
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.930
Odd so output 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8462133

4251e174-0837-4ab1-8706-1b4056415452
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.416
The 4th one. The number
of ones is 2, so true

NOTE Confidence: 0.8462133

d9dbe0e1-f660-412f-93ed-059438651a86
00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:42.396
is even you output one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85983765

22355025-898e-45e6-ba98-1c1c609311d4
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:52.168
For the input at 5100, the
number of ones is 1, one is odd.

NOTE Confidence: 0.76269764

143a75df-0cd1-4ae7-be83-4a3ccff61ca9
00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.096
So this way you fill out the
output and now you decide

NOTE Confidence: 0.76269764

91ac21c6-b6a1-4388-a6da-09be10c76149
00:08:01.096 --> 00:08:05.076
 whether you want to design it by SOP or POS

NOTE Confidence: 0.81136084

6a72adf4-4038-425c-b3a4-9bad58bcd62e
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:12.206
So I already said that you if
you try to design it by a

NOTE Confidence: 0.81136084

358ecd20-3744-4ae6-a4df-a4902e1d1667
00:08:12.206 --> 00:08:14.376
circuit that needs less number

NOTE Confidence: 0.8380311

033911de-2e69-421b-82ed-8471780c917d
00:08:14.376 --> 00:08:20.770
of gates. So if you design it by
the SOP, meaning that the by

NOTE Confidence: 0.8380311

d6d7223b-2e5e-4b92-8e0f-6d266de3e182
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.170
 minterms you look at the entries, that makes it one in

f2f9a9af-61b1-47b3-a5bb-1d522681d628
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.570
the output. So 1234 unit 4

NOTE Confidence: 0.8088755

28b5de7f-6360-4585-8b68-1cf889f71663
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:33.484
minterms. However, if you look at those into that makes it 0 or 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8088755

c889de9b-434d-4fc2-91df-fde2d142baee
00:08:33.484 --> 00:08:38.308
designed by POS or maxterm, you have to look at those

a16add4c-1dfd-4df1-ae81-5eac5d08385f
00:08:38.308 --> 00:08:43.534
entities that are 0 so 1234. So
in this case whether you design

9f8c176b-34d3-48b1-81fd-326ff7f32e7e
00:08:43.534 --> 00:08:48.760
 it by SOP or design it by POS doesn't matter. Both has the

00:08:53.182 --> 00:08:57.604
the option usually in the
question they say that we want

8b6a363e-9d2e-4697-ab36-83b8e8d06612

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.306
design by POS. But if they don't
give you any particular design,

fca1a6df-373c-42b4-a58f-bfabd8daadc4
00:09:06.306 --> 00:09:08.126

29699196-5d7a-4ce2-98d4-1d6f30589eba
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:17.250
followed by the not. So this one maxterm one is mid term one

d08505ca-9c6d-4c08-b6c2-3b52c0ee5390
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.890
 followed by the nots.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.147
And then the next one is here.

7884bb4c-fcd2-463b-8dbb-f2bd2655d0f2
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.490
 This is the maxterm

c5ed6dd3-4124-4063-94e4-e7948b8eb9e7
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.290
Two because the binary digit in
the input is 2.

eb5d46dc-b575-4693-86cd-f7caa7c37e3d
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:45.069
 The maxterm 2 is equal to minterm and two followed by the not.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.186
 Here's the maxterm 7. So another way to show the maxterm

NOTE Confidence: 0.78025055

782e810c-91b5-4f0d-ad59-68a6608d90ce
00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.720
The product maxterm 1, maxterm 2

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.210
 And with maxterm 4. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.76534104

bea9309f-9f80-4101-8437-de861e1bf955
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.185
Another shorter forms discussed
product using the Pi symbol

 product of maxterm 1247.

5eb5d3c3-8e2f-49be-95dc-c353c78b171f
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:21.685
So one trick is this. So you
see the the numbers here. These

NOTE Confidence: 0.8090809

afd38861-fa61-4093-989e-75a5afe87a53
00:11:21.685 --> 00:11:27.745
 are the numbers that wouldn't be in the minterms, so the minterms 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8090809

7dd17793-58c5-4c7b-8166-9ee3ee379203
00:11:27.745 --> 00:11:33.300
 are Sigma minterms 035 and six. The maxterms are those numbers

e8b9b7d1-1122-428f-8d94-33d04037a00f
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.855
 that are not in the minterm, so product or maxterm 1247.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.960
 So whatever number happens in the minterms, it doesn't happen 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8238289

2682557d-acc5-46dc-ac72-d351ab30062a

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.623
This is the maxterm one, so for myself it's hard to come up

NOTE Confidence: 0.82498974

4bc2b49a-3284-4757-b96d-49500e933849
00:11:58.623 --> 00:12:03.677
 with the Max term, so I usually say that Maxterm and one is minterm

00:12:03.677 --> 00:12:08.731

for me. So I create the meeting

ebee4056-1fca-4ba3-9fbd-40932951fb87
00:12:08.731 --> 00:12:13.063
 one and then followed by the not becomes this so just to

00:12:13.063 --> 00:12:17.756
 show you that. So I usually say that maxterm one is minterm one

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:26.426
So what is missing one return
one is 001, followed by then

638c211d-cae5-4ce5-bb95-255d739924d4
00:12:26.426 --> 00:12:29.830
not. So it becomes one.

3b5efc37-9224-4888-90de-b43c1193ef5c
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.058

cb500203-8782-43db-ae90-0d8a64c6bfc7
00:12:42.518 --> 00:12:44.308
do this for the maxterms.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:50.442
 But you can memorize what is the maxterm. For instance two and

017abd66-e671-46b9-bf05-689c24762e08
00:12:50.442 --> 00:12:55.194
 then come up with the minterm. And then you design the circuit

80d36de8-5e8c-4b6f-81f3-378da48320da
00:12:55.194 --> 00:12:59.946
so maxterm two is export. Or why
bar Z. So here is.

can see here is attached to X,

b46d12d7-7ecf-43c9-bddb-bfbcd858dcec

00:15:10.968 --> 00:15:17.140
is this. Majority Circuit is
a circuit. We later see what

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.621
So basically you have to count
the number of zeros you have to

9cadd8f1-7cb2-415d-9b41-2fde95257b9b
00:15:44.621 --> 00:15:49.132

00:36:34.441 --> 00:36:41.231
it possible to design any

00:36:41.231 --> 00:36:46.210
gates? Once you have the
problem, you know how to design

no gate for not.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:12.700
So. Here is the question, is it
possible to design A circuit?

e7247164-e526-4acb-bcbd-650d9f028fd4
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.804
Only using some specific
set of gates.

e23da906-26cd-40aa-a2df-ef038407330a
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.908
Why, as I said, sometimes you
are not. Some gates are not

677d431b-be5f-497f-b9dd-b63c1c8b6173
00:37:25.908 --> 00:37:28.940
available at your hand.
Sometimes this is very

2393e615-45d5-4014-9f82-e2d11ff9fdea
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.716
important. Sometimes you go
to the market and you see

2b314540-b8a4-47ff-a559-c1c6ecfe5f1a
00:37:32.716 --> 00:37:35.856
that some gates are expensive
than the others, so you.

c808365e-270e-4ef8-8554-f8b39e2c3dd6
00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.796
I really know how to build not
fine and an if then and or

8e78791e-2e22-46d6-bb58-cb044cd47f82
00:37:46.796 --> 00:37:50.690
cheaper I combine and to come up
with a not gate.

36eb57ab-913f-46e8-9a60-d57c7644ae0b
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:58.491
So this is another way to
design AI mean cheaper circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8783347

30f16f0f-79f6-4699-b8a7-0f535bc54198
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:07.982
So let's start with the complete
or is with the full set.

7fbfb98b-c4c9-449e-9626-27d6621216ea
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:13.586
When we have all the available
gates at our hands, so we

cd7bbecd-d4b6-462e-8134-8372e907572f
00:38:13.586 --> 00:38:18.565
already know that we can design
any circuit by not and and or.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7757885

1b82e8d6-a39d-40ed-869f-7723c8b40389
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:24.068
Also, if you are given
and or.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7434884

9aaa79dc-1f99-4410-993e-9ebcd7647170
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:31.270
Second, sorry, we can't.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8407114

b07fdb23-d652-4e7e-818b-366f012bf1d7
00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:35.112
I have not. Whenever we need a
NAND gate, we can use it or

NOTE Confidence: 0.8407114

dd081b14-8aa7-4444-9c33-a6a80f799ba3
00:38:35.112 --> 00:38:38.141
whenever we need to know that
we can use it. So these are

8c9b4642-4e7e-4a5a-a5c9-b303646b5d6e
00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:40.005
the available goods. For
instance in the market.

c9ce16ef-8c61-465b-9bb2-999daa16e61d
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:46.204
So our question is that if we
don't have that, is it still

NOTE Confidence: 0.8820229

3565e645-6720-4e56-b947-3c6389cba19a
00:38:46.204 --> 00:38:49.606
possible to design the
circuit? How can I replace

ca56655b-d010-44c3-a7d2-7d7c590d86bb
00:38:49.606 --> 00:38:51.118
none in the circuit?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8243543

4a5c2629-7d48-4b32-8c43-d355e37cae8b
00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:57.511
So we already said that Nat
is and plus not. So you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8243543

a2a6477f-a5c8-46f3-8934-d1d6a95b4914
00:38:57.511 --> 00:39:02.802
simply build than and by just
a two and not gate. So it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8243543

df39d61d-6cd1-40fd-8c25-ceaccdeb1519
00:39:02.802 --> 00:39:07.279
very easy to rebuild that.
The same is with North. So

db2e7f3e-677f-4704-9f22-d13edfe6ce9c
00:39:07.279 --> 00:39:12.163
whenever in your circuit you
need an OR gate you can see.

67aa6e4b-6762-451f-be42-a2ed20d2f3fa
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.364
Can buy or not scared and then
attach them together just to

work you as in or git.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.288
So basically you can reduce this
set to this set so any circuit

NOTE Confidence: 0.8545942

51d9de00-4db2-4dd6-988e-457a96151bb4
00:39:29.288 --> 00:39:31.920
can be redesigned by not and or.

0930001a-73f1-4572-a3ac-a14e937c1bac
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:39.416
So the next is this. Can we
reduce this set further to see

NOTE Confidence: 0.8583272

838d10d3-dce6-4267-8555-8f41eca7cefe
00:39:39.416 --> 00:39:41.708
that? I mean for instance here?

706be93c-4ba5-49d0-8b7d-f407a660e5e4
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:49.892
Can I design any circuit by only
not and and so? Basically we say

NOTE Confidence: 0.8275893

784db63a-5cc8-41f3-86dc-a49bfe2c601a
00:39:49.892 --> 00:39:56.951
that we don't need or. So here's
the question. Can we design or?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8099557

fdc0bd14-2978-41b6-879a-72e81c714ec6
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:08.700
410 you can we do this not on or
basically we just drop the OR

NOTE Confidence: 0.8508323

13e2b6b5-6572-4367-8699-542e9fbabe92
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:13.977
gate? Sorry, dropped the and
gate and build the end by only,

475f13e0-4cc4-4efe-b731-f21b5c61e0a1
00:40:13.977 --> 00:40:19.255
not on. Or is it possible to do
that or not? And then let's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8508323

3f8b4d22-5887-4b6a-bd21-8697f1fef0f9
00:40:19.255 --> 00:40:24.156
check whether we can reduce the
sets more. Only one gate. Is it

NOTE Confidence: 0.8508323

1063c316-ce70-4fdd-be09-fa51fa7f6a77
00:40:24.156 --> 00:40:26.418
possible to build any circuit by

NOTE Confidence: 0.8484772

8f04383f-014d-4f31-bbf4-2d89e4ed3433
00:40:26.418 --> 00:40:30.960
nuts? Yes, the answer to this
question is this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83802056

eb706a2e-09fd-4d22-9bfc-1d8fb6bd2d14
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.750
If we could build or an end with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8722823

ec6fcf33-cac7-4aca-aaea-f52ff84a6727
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:40.300
nuts. Then we are good to go
because we have and and or by

NOTE Confidence: 0.8722823

ba08fb3c-cf58-4edb-addb-9a72a3ddf512
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.360
did not. So then we can come up
to this full set.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8768306

56d20824-31ab-45d7-b0ab-28e7d2e352b8
00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:48.369
So basically, whenever we could
build, rebuild a gate and come

NOTE Confidence: 0.8768306

880761aa-2d9b-4caa-9f27-b18d19bcf627
00:40:48.369 --> 00:40:50.763
up to the disk original set.

It means that it.

edc1a8a1-c56d-454a-a43b-48611f81ab0e
00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:02.059
So for instance, or if you are
given only or gate, is it

NOTE Confidence: 0.8702305

22bbb806-18a4-45ad-981c-e5becd330bb1
00:41:02.059 --> 00:41:03.624
possible to design any circuit?

3718a179-7c77-4582-bf8d-fbd6f5e5ad93
00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:08.874
In order to answer this, we have
to check whether we can design

NOTE Confidence: 0.8311946

50915062-9a68-413c-867b-b9c3f33804db
00:41:08.874 --> 00:41:14.094
and with or and not with or. And
if you could that then we have

NOTE Confidence: 0.8311946

2fccd713-f804-4762-bf3d-5f63239a7052
00:41:14.094 --> 00:41:16.530
not end and create an or gate.

75a78598-f4ca-4bfd-b7d2-5f2a2b6188eb
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.582
So the answer to this question
gonna be reduced to this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8661755

08bc93ac-8a34-4b3b-b834-3836e1977235
00:41:21.582 --> 00:41:25.564
question if we could design not
an end with or gate.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9058874

ef883b15-ee60-4ad2-a46a-9471bb8fb56b
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:31.130
I know.

fa12f269-e843-428e-8be5-4b0ebf4b9373
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.348
So let's check them.

e11a4df4-3990-4867-a0e7-e25c75a16821
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:39.363
So the first one is this. Is it
possible to design any circuit

NOTE Confidence: 0.8681839

761c146b-bc14-4209-a26c-113f1eb1b93a
00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:40.807
by not an Ant?

dd6adc50-8bda-45fb-b373-4c29c0ebd7ef
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:46.796
So to answer this, we only have
to check whether we can design

NOTE Confidence: 0.87962013

80bd7f77-6177-4495-8ef7-8e247b6ad8a0
00:41:46.796 --> 00:41:52.424
or with these two or not. If you
could design or then we receive.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.310
Have the full set and
then the answer is yes.

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:55.114
It's not with itself. It is like

isn't itself, so we can simply
apply F2 by two nuts.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:05.900

doesn't have any impact.

ab7cf126-e094-44bd-b3bb-8cbc862e0ab6
01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:46.680

13b3503d-3729-422d-99c4-6dc65b8075ec
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:08.330
beta. So you have Alpha and

NOTE Confidence: 0.7920032

00d4ca41-afd2-4a6b-8d36-c2ef07d57f33
01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:12.606
beta not. So this is
Alpha and and beta.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83723664

c299e95e-7ced-486e-8899-7a838a9610a8
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.420
So the final expression
is this. All the gates

NOTE Confidence: 0.83723664

cb2f0269-51e0-4855-8e01-c096e26c0647
01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:24.120
are not except in nuts.

2d122373-197b-4998-a3ac-7389f734eecf
01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:25.980
So.

NOTE Confidence: 0.685043

c7b2788d-177d-4ce1-a74a-e40d7e4ff6e1
01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.420
Or an Ant all becomes NAND.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8595028

f8966367-4baa-45c7-b45f-50c7968af18c
01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.270
Except I'm not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8015193

9a65e00b-d751-49bd-bcae-ea8f50655ea8
01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:39.101
So if you see here, if I
redesign this circuit, it

NOTE Confidence: 0.8015193

da4cfa4d-0664-48e4-9ec1-b5a549207008
01:03:39.101 --> 01:03:40.143
becomes export.

NOTE Confidence: 0.64059466

fb1fd7c6-4fbf-4c84-b018-f1030882ea0c
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:46.430
Why Ball Z NAND so this becomes
a NAND gate?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9421502

8057193f-bbdf-4ce8-b230-2dda75d19d2b
01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.500
And then this one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8704014

a837db35-c0a8-4c31-94c6-10aa0d140c60
01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.990
And followed by the nuts.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84836024

d29e9c93-f3ca-4ccf-83dd-4c5ac3f61696
01:03:55.240 --> 01:04:01.610
And then all of them instead of

NOTE Confidence: 0.59738785

b0b86a88-df3c-4080-a481-9b1e0d704b67
01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.380
Followed by the nuts ornans.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8507108

c0732a50-497e-4e61-9d62-a99fa67bfab6
01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.150
So here is the chant.

NOTE Confidence: 0.81836706

b9ec1fb7-45f3-41ee-a37e-99f0a223e196
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:17.034
So you see, it's very simple to
redesign a circuit which is

NOTE Confidence: 0.81836706

76a8803b-5e6f-4b93-a506-be4919e53941
01:04:17.034 --> 01:04:19.819
based on the aesopi too.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87519515

657f8c64-5e4d-4528-873f-d44566de3d93
01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:25.450
And.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8133391

5b87cd48-750d-4b64-a12c-bc3d0b62f0c2
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:32.270
So let's do another practice
and this function, the F1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8133391

27308133-8392-45fe-9178-383d34e3cf23
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:34.070
This is the aesopi.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7140828

04d4a95c-be58-47c7-b786-18b8a084fb18
01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:41.548
So midterms all with each other.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8327765

ea2ca186-7de9-469a-b665-ff5bec4e79fb
01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:48.670
So simply I apply two nuts on
top of each other.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75040054

60239553-ba64-4391-b27d-2a8bb29ac9d0
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:53.190
Then I write rewrite F1
as a midterms.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8172427

8c9b43d0-92b1-4139-8953-9d1d2ef81687
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:59.994
Then I decide to bring the first
nut inside the parenthesis, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.8172427

7917a0a3-2393-4e2c-beac-067332a89d69
01:04:59.994 --> 01:05:04.107
all the midterms becomes
midterms, followed by the nuts.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8119697

f4ab2c6b-65cc-47d9-977b-d270e14f0dd1
01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:10.276
And then if you re write the
midterms followed by the nut,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8119697

9edc95ec-f056-42b3-b249-e1f01db5fadc
01:05:10.276 --> 01:05:13.906
they become an followed by the
nut, which is not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.860572

c991f2a3-3207-4b0e-af9c-038a0f308cfc
01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:19.556
So the first name, second and
third enforcement I have to put

NOTE Confidence: 0.860572

924f574a-71c6-425d-9488-592f79ebb591

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.549
And then if you consider
each term.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7907323

b025452c-6b68-4163-9b78-bf404a7f3d77
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:31.994
So followed by the nuts it
becomes end of them followed by

NOTE Confidence: 0.7907323

a7f62b34-efd4-464f-860e-d41068c88910
01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:35.646
the nut, which is not so.
Basically it means that replace

c2e96e1a-351f-4d37-9343-47166bd9c1c9
01:05:35.646 --> 01:05:37.306
all these. Anthony, this or.

5c4cd563-76fe-4a5a-82b9-75d9164856d7
01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.040
With that

NOTE Confidence: 0.84746295

f6a08d84-32a2-4ffa-8e92-0662800843e6
01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:50.403
so again, no. This is
the circuit before, and

NOTE Confidence: 0.84746295

a45d778b-f143-4e0a-9a0f-11d7233b916a
01:05:50.403 --> 01:05:52.688
this is the circuit net.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7929493

81050ae4-4250-4ed8-9f5e-7a3f34c69b90
01:05:57.390 --> 01:06:01.416
And we put all these two
together. So as circuit that

NOTE Confidence: 0.7929493

0c9d6314-784d-4493-8720-89eaadeadafc
01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:06.906
used to be on 1st, all Ann and
the second level or or gate. Now

d488dcb0-b510-4fec-a3f4-558358b7c146
01:06:06.906 --> 01:06:09.102
all of them becomes NAND Gate.

36c3d648-d20c-4e42-b1d7-f8c6facb33db
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:16.993
You would say that what happens
to these nuts?

NOTE Confidence: 0.77491957

0dc0cfa0-dac6-45f6-b18f-4fa41297b234
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:20.842
So we know that how can we build

NOTE Confidence: 0.902687

c022c1b1-f653-4699-81d0-4546bb1ba61f
01:06:20.842 --> 01:06:23.350
the knot finance? So basically

NOTE Confidence: 0.7509423

b49a1984-d6a1-4078-a929-28c099f475b9
01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:29.670
replace those. Not gates with
this gate, none with same input.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9418946

8c32104b-33df-496e-aa88-3eb66fd538a6
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:35.990
So here is the algorithm.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7207114

1dcf45f1-9149-4afa-afa6-b87b0d6cd43f
01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:40.028
Whenever you do 2 nuts on top of

01:06:40.028 --> 01:06:45.430
the aesopi. You end with a
circuit that only has NAND gate.

915aec13-b050-46f7-9c2d-ccee29450bcf
01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:52.585
So you would say ask what, what
if I have POS or product of sums

01:06:57.310 --> 01:06:58.570
can I do this?

f821f54b-0442-4871-aeb8-eb730d583bf4
01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.010
You have this option when you

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:15.066

gate? Is it possible to design

0ddf2fe6-3eea-4e86-93fe-1d558f08e3bc
01:07:15.066 --> 01:07:17.478
the any circuit by Norgate? We

c55ca52f-891f-4522-8799-fae3b4592f4e
01:07:17.478 --> 01:07:19.680
said yes. So.

f920a3fe-4ee6-419a-83c0-3c0f5ab31a7c
01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:25.344
For the Norgate, if you follow
this same algorithm we did for

7b2d75f8-ccb7-410e-8d00-56a4de5c759e
01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:44.374
Finally, you will see a gate.
You will see a circuit that has

only nor gates.

6f76af48-27a5-4bed-b7d9-73832fd402aa
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:54.190
So.

ae46120e-9a72-45fa-9ebb-4dd740a8b092
01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:58.807
If you have a question

Here are two options. Either you
design this circuit boy sum of

products or aesopi.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7941585

235ddaa5-2c20-422f-8986-58579c65ffb6

By some of the meters.

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:15.287
So you have to look at those
into. That makes the output one.

a2c43c34-9e56-4334-b015-9c11fa082af4
01:08:15.287 --> 01:08:18.077
The first level is and the

874f21be-be52-479b-a4eb-ec10fdb5a239
01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:25.318
And you can do two nuts on top
of the SOP to come up with an

13b783ce-8f9e-4701-ae28-318deb17b38b
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:35.970
If you choose to design it based
on the POS.

7e6fab92-13a8-49ad-8047-c429457126cf
01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:41.183
So basically the first level is

1741d2a4-9cf6-4066-ad43-26150541dd78
01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:45.616
you have to look at the maximums
Max terms are those that makes

8d72965f-f3cd-42b9-9f86-e48504dd0baa
01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:53.172
Max turns also did not admit

01:08:53.172 --> 01:08:57.528
product of maxterms or end of
the Max terms and if you

70245a7f-38c4-4ae5-aa50-44d187cda94f

follow this.

dbd6aebf-99a1-49e3-a1e4-c2b8a46d6760
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:08.070
maxterms, you end up with a circuit that has only Nor gate.

e621d82d-abac-4758-b68a-a43bf96b6ff3
01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.196
So we can do this at home.

0eafd76d-c106-449b-b06d-ffa240112649
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:13.898

01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:21.614
And so, based on this algorithm
that just applied 2, not on top

do not apply the second, not.
You can change so Peten and only
