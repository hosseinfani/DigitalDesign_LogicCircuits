does the modular program have to be the same as the one in the lab manual?

so you can only combine adjacent boxes?

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.900
<v Ben Chittle>
Exclusive or

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:14.900
<v Nick Boisclair>
could we have written our headers for YX as 00,01,10,11 then change the minterms as well?

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:46.900
<v Nick Boisclair>
nevermind

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:31.900
<v Phillip Bocse>
so you always write towards the middle? that is, when you hit the middle you start from the other side?

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:53.900
<v Nick Boisclair>
ok

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:04.900
