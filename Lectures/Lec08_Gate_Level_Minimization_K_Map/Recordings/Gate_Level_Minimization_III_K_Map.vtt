and why we do that because we want

f03ef16b-ad54-4bc5-a424-25d0c1d0eb45
00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:06.587

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.708
we have to make it discreet and we

372bb1ba-7514-461e-bd81-a9ace927c1f6
00:06:11.708 --> 00:06:14.336

a system that will represent the

00:06:17.201 --> 00:06:19.987
discrete units and now we need to

00:06:19.987 --> 00:06:22.411
build a machine that process the

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.548
So that was the outer start.

a17092b1-6c6d-4f8f-a965-57c3581b852a
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.080
For this semester.

d8aa90cf-2cd1-4cbc-a567-dabed7bfb059
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.576
And this was our road map,

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.286
so we start from numbering systems,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876356

43eeb281-0436-4d93-912c-a19d93bb7dd1
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.850
how to represent discrete units

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.732
and then we said that we choose

4c955c7f-ed32-4eef-8fd3-08bc3ddbd794
00:06:42.732 --> 00:06:45.180
the binary numbering system.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.940
Becausw it is more robust because

9ea8f73a-9c9a-44c3-a6b0-a1e23c354cae
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.780
of the engineering issues.

4f3bb08f-ae9d-4cfa-872d-1c54cc340dcf
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.060
We said that the binary system is more

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.319
robust to noise that that's why we

0de5e071-9de3-4db6-a713-501968cb12a1
00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:59.440
choose among all the numbering systems.

47f13db4-48c7-4bfd-b9b5-d74c8292003c
00:07:00.898 --> 00:07:03.814
We choose the binary system and

f12bc7c8-5ffb-477b-9b1a-9a4fe2d891eb
00:07:03.814 --> 00:07:06.525
then based on the binary system

NOTE Confidence: 0.876356

395d0af4-73be-42ac-b62d-8f5bddb2e1db
00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:09.473
because also it had some mathematic

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.500
So we said that that was a good choice

aff34556-fb88-4b13-8f67-62b9df0845df
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.440
to build a system on top of that.

c6b0d9f8-9fb0-42a8-a6c1-aac4828ead20
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.936
Then we introduced logic gates that

a03bcd75-8d38-43ec-bc67-f4e7ef6b055d
00:07:22.936 --> 00:07:25.484
these are just basically some small

00:07:25.484 --> 00:07:27.926
units that process the binary units.

eff39ff2-6d9a-47dd-aa80-e41533fe6bb6
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.373
Oh, binary variables an or X or an etc.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.286
And then we start designing some

459fee39-7629-4da7-b301-f2e15a369cb2
00:07:39.286 --> 00:07:42.340
more complex circuits such as.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.236
The example it was in in the exam,

00:07:47.718 --> 00:07:50.466
design the circuit by some of midterms

69db2b10-ba26-4a1c-af0d-4ffcf5e900be
00:07:50.466 --> 00:07:53.337
 or a product of the Max terms and

00:07:53.337 --> 00:07:55.427
then simplify them and attach.

5acac4ae-66f7-4294-a175-261c7db9c8a6
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.845
So we are in the middle of

5c96acd6-9b04-4907-a6ed-e1bc60f7f264
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.077
We have three more steps up until

cb2642cb-5af1-4d39-bbb1-9fb6180f0051
00:08:03.077 --> 00:08:04.840

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.374
so we have to be patient for

21bcf0f8-8ba5-4bd8-b26a-318321ca975e
00:08:07.374 --> 00:08:10.352
the next few weeks that how can

00:08:10.352 --> 00:08:12.607
we build a computer system.

24722185-2222-421a-87e9-dbb4ef858bbe
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.679
But so far we are here whatever we design

e008687e-3de7-4d7f-a15e-73442dac6fe4
00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:18.737
so far is called combinational logic.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.700
but whatever we design so far,

da0ff8f4-593b-4a11-9ef3-dc52c243a91a
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.520
we minimize so far.

a73dbbcc-10ee-4e48-927c-76fa8bffd4f7
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.250
And the final circuit we call

12827b34-a473-493d-8185-3f5ee0fdc453
00:08:30.346 --> 00:08:33.038
them large combination logic.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.553
Compared to another type of logic with

00:08:35.553 --> 00:08:38.157
which we design in the next few weeks,

454bcc16-c5c2-4bcd-b560-fb96aeeda0f2
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.540
which is which we call sequential logic.

2c353073-e424-4d59-ba3e-8f3de875df12
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.609
So we are in the middle of the trip.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.670
So when we design A circuit,

394aa766-a0a6-4000-8493-87ff317ef8eb
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.190
we said that it is good to

and because of these factors we

ad0a1610-cf25-4afc-899e-3ee30ae79070
00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:39.658
You have to follow an order,

f1164b0b-3ea1-44ae-ac12-b85d2a0e2ae1
00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.819
so when X is zero, Y is zero and Z is 0.

2cc280cb-9168-4a83-84b3-3fe6af57327f
00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.896
So this is the midterm 0,

e7c2bc54-6acb-4815-a1b5-de204790726d
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:49.548
so you put midterms right here.

ecac48ff-8fb1-4287-9998-ca50695a2a79
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:52.990

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:56.286
As you can see here we have XY,

cef5a159-64a5-4662-b694-47e5fdc42d85
00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:58.578
so XYX is 1.

98f689b0-36d5-4310-9ab6-fd222ea33fd0
00:40:58.578 --> 00:41:00.866
Why is 0Z zero?

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:10.415

f71b3d00-ddf9-4093-8325-2bcce64bfb27
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.462

NOTE Confidence: 0.90823185

811a235b-b7ab-4c72-96f2-a3410d4b707f
00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:36.590
now becomes zero and whenever F becomes 0,

fae420fa-eec0-409c-b165-73ec4d3b50d0
00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:37.676
now becomes one.

dbb553de-67ea-47bb-836a-77cb73672390
00:58:37.676 --> 00:58:40.830
So if you make it F for basically

f9500fe2-946c-4b1e-bf9b-13634d80db30
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:44.010
this happens in the corner map.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90823185

401a50e0-42e6-4485-9f85-4d9edca8940d
00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:47.898
All this says that where one becomes zero and

be111ad0-7ee9-4681-96a3-e599ff5fc22e
00:58:47.898 --> 00:58:51.680
the cells that were zero now becomes one.

4eb1bf90-d5eb-4434-8a87-c2cc38761847
00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:55.376
So I assume that I want to minimize

NOTE Confidence: 0.90823185

00:58:55.376 --> 00:58:58.788
the F bar using corner map.

fa66b35c-fba1-498a-bf77-d7874361c834
00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:01.359
So now we have two cells with

b4b1d25b-366c-4d91-ac07-9908f2d4f81c
00:59:01.359 --> 00:59:03.399
one adjustment to each other.

ee295e22-5bbd-4a84-8dbf-b314d68897f8
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:07.240
So in this cell the value of Z is 1,

NOTE Confidence: 0.90823185

60ebde98-78db-48f4-bd21-fe27163c41fa
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.538
the value of Y is 0.

3d5d13c9-0ecc-4a75-ac45-f03fca2ca35f
00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.996
The value of X is either zero and one.

15c436a6-3b84-45f6-9ba8-0d2d93abe294
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.402
So the value of X doesn't matter and this

NOTE Confidence: 0.90823185

1c166c0b-8466-4972-8d5f-ecb01fb72078
00:59:16.402 --> 00:59:20.388
is the minimized Boolean function for F bar.

36cb58fd-78a5-4a62-87c3-aaa07049b211
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.766
So if I apply another bar,

c47985e8-c8ab-415f-923b-41242a1eb969
00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:25.930
we already know that F4 bar becomes F.

f1bfbdfc-998e-4884-833d-b84a530038f3
00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:29.494
So this is the minimized version of the F4I.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90823185

829e77ca-0c41-430b-9857-fcd8b26b06fb
00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.480
Apply another board to bring

00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.460
it back to the F.

6e2296a5-f510-4442-9ed5-05ff94519f9e
00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:35.440
So if you apply that,

NOTE Confidence: 0.90823185

180d0a4d-cbf8-4dcb-9c52-fd76726cc8e2
00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:40.208
it becomes this by the D Morgan's law.

abb21531-83c9-4edf-a9db-0d0e0b1efeb2
00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:43.270
So you see how it is easy to use the

If you have the Boolean function

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.715
You basically create shared vision

you minimize each of these Boolean functions,

we end up with the same minimized version.
