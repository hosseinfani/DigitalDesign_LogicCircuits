c769db4c-fcc1-4acd-b9d0-50076c693d99

43539ec6-14f7-4bfd-ae4d-ca20111ee93d
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.207

So in two weeks and then we

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.063

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:58.821

then we start with one variable,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.414
One thing is that we said

0d288d88-400c-4ba8-8b41-a6cf06111e18
00:02:35.414 --> 00:02:37.639
 that by using the Karnaugh map,

ad321605-3e0c-4cfb-a793-c97e5beb6cca
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.125
not only we can design the product

f9b94728-ce27-4859-938c-02c8d0883777
00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:42.874
some of midterms, but also we can

0e98cef2-1b2d-475d-9baf-f160589983d1
00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:44.979
design the product of maxterms.

b4c9fee8-816b-4114-9b75-1e2834cd6aad
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.626
So and also the mean terms,

3a0b3c40-6e88-43f7-80b8-39c273e9e250
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.599
the order of the minterms in the map matters,

332aa3c6-7fdf-405e-a7bf-08aa17d2e726
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.928
so we have to practice a lot in

ac4ac8d2-35d3-4b19-aeec-88e735effa3c
00:02:54.928 --> 00:02:57.996
order to make it part of our

00:03:05.832 --> 00:03:08.790
way we do this from here.

4208884a-8d26-42ad-b2cc-190934d5fc30
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.558
And then from here.

1d70778d-a001-48f8-a31b-98b3251a6fa9
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.545
And they found seven to go to

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:18.390
here 8 and etc usually are in.

7928865b-07bd-45dd-ba98-fe29d36747b9
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.896
In this course we are using the

00:03:22.843 --> 00:03:25.622
and so there is one thing that.

a913e11a-3629-4027-8791-15f7914a57df
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.598
 So this is the road map for minterms.

2617d408-3799-4a6d-984d-92d51176af2f
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.328
And whenever we are, we are asked to

36f85986-1f19-4d2b-a73e-b2b8dfe2753e
00:03:32.328 --> 00:03:35.435
design A circuit by the sum of midterms.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.530
So basically for these midterms

NOTE Confidence: 0.8428146

94b78e74-cf35-4b0b-a77d-a239a483a070
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.600
we make it 1 in the cells.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.240
And for the remaining items,

07473c42-a35f-41e0-b807-d92cde9c27fd
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.438
we make it 0, so it's another

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.707
But this way we can minimize by

fced0135-592d-443f-bca2-7b35e87be537
00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:50.244

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.915
And if you have a region of two variables,

ec8f4ed9-2798-4e44-9fa4-aa00383232e5
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.992

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.467
it removes two variables and then 8

cb9dbef7-eb19-4c39-b12d-200cfe7a4786
00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:06.900

cea2b360-7942-4a61-8bd8-0c5566c5f1ee

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.517
We can assume that we are writing for F4,

1f6cd3e6-81ea-46ab-8338-ccb8a02f0ca2
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.520

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:30.278
This is a 1819 and etc.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.884

00:10:32.884 --> 00:10:35.848
because I we basically says that this

58e9505a-8b6b-4c2e-8985-6a58e2fea2e6
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.402
So if you map all these midterms to

00:10:45.402 --> 00:10:48.459
the original value of the midterms,

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.738
20 is 1, so it becomes a. For instance.

uh, so this is midterm 16.

fc8a9ca0-31c3-4a52-ade1-df231c47168f
00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:13.618
where is the midterm 10 midterm turn is here?

2ecf0efd-695b-4bff-a551-26d3a508fc2f
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:28.200
which is mid term 10 with T equal to 1.

9c172f4b-096a-4dd1-a1f3-79cf6d1ff031
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.737
So mid term term is here T0 and when

So this is the meter.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:45.450

00:11:46.926 --> 00:11:50.618
So this is the exact mid term here and

00:11:50.618 --> 00:11:53.845
then when you want to minimize that,

5180da48-e9bb-425e-bbff-e26f41f0879c
00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.602
we have to consider this as a 3D

So this is the minimization,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.868
so we can make this adjustment or region

00:12:04.868 --> 00:12:08.460
so the region right now is not 2D,

ef498561-bfb8-4a3a-8480-7c221f454c42
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.172
they are 3D regions,

46fcb957-44d3-42ef-ab89-341af17e5cf2
00:12:10.172 --> 00:12:13.859
so it's basically it's a cube or cylinder.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.801
so this is a huge difference between

so the outputs are just after

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:42.282
So imagine we design A most

00:26:42.282 --> 00:26:44.713
simplest circuit that has only one

and and two input variables and

cb1e6b0b-94dd-4fc3-beb0-cf5a0f95c9b9
00:26:47.065 --> 00:26:49.408
there's only one output variable.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.988
So this is a I can draw a truth table by

00:26:52.988 --> 00:26:56.116

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.885

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.909
if you want to see the output of F,

00:27:40.228 --> 00:27:45.328
at this time, why drops to 0?

00:27:50.722 --> 00:27:55.647
so we have Y zero and then X is 1 so.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.350
Because the input changes

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.050
the output gonna change,

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:04.150
so the input is now is zero and then X is 1.

b586fe8d-5786-4b41-8419-fdd429cc8c27
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:11.446

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.660
the output changes right away.

If one of the input changes,

The wide changes from one to zero after

00:29:09.051 --> 00:29:12.659
a little bit delaye because we have to

00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:16.315
see what happens inside the and gate.

a4c27a79-09fd-4d24-803e-ad15bc45e88a
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.660
So XP is still one.

bb1e15fc-9689-46c8-8ce1-52e54578ecb9
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.990

822d8a5d-bae4-4888-afc7-480b3cd0956c

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:52.340
so F is 1, but suddenly Y drops to 0.

f652d300-bcc0-4c13-b30c-2137d864c42b
00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:56.470
So now if we have zero in the YX is

00:29:56.589 --> 00:30:00.719

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.070
So this is the property

the output changes after some deley or gap.

In this course,

00:30:17.363 --> 00:30:19.890
we assume that the gates are ideal.

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.002
There is no delay and right

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.386
the output actually gonna be changed.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:30.000
So the Delta T or the gate the delay is.

e36f8e3e-0e16-4b34-9ece-ee8ff84a03f8
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.064

Sometimes coding is not two way.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.720
We can only code one way,

one way coding is called hashing.

f2a2cd80-d098-444b-b0e4-f24eed9ef498
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.150
there is a very small chance for
