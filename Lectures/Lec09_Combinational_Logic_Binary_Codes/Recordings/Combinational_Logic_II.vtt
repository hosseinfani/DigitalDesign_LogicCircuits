c8bb2e56-b0be-4910-bb61-545880ba7dcc
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.984
We just know how to use the

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.926
that in it in an actual design

186bf046-e498-4df8-b578-827d3377581e
00:05:46.926 --> 00:05:49.242
which is for the code conversion.

b6424480-c40a-492d-b355-1bfac2e3cb6a
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.150
Yes, that's a good practice. For this.

3ea929ac-84d6-4f20-965f-d01af6c1ea04
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:09.050
OK, so. Let's start up.

00:06:40.175 --> 00:06:42.810

7f37c5e0-2392-4ad8-8bac-7d69ac04b231
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.352
So far we could design any digital

b7de75d8-a1a0-4e23-a78b-d1264066dd4d
00:06:48.352 --> 00:06:51.100
units for any type of purposes.

68dba199-8895-41ba-acc6-81cee756bfd6
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.956
But now we want to focus toward

e9a09beb-200a-44c9-98d6-d06642d66e5e
00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:55.830

935cfd04-e05b-4e50-8ede-160312017ae4
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.930
That's why we designed we

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.560
make a category of the unit,

cf0ef32b-e09e-447f-a2c0-dbbeebd9b444
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.710
and this is all units.

06319635-3cf5-4924-87fa-a42321486eb8
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.818
We said that we have a big

2f33a654-7ecb-4f65-a4e0-27f0f0f6a679
00:07:05.818 --> 00:07:07.150
category of combination.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.250
Logic, which basically those sectors that

d00e1893-494a-40b5-aa7d-117a110cd5fd
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.920
we design so far is in this category.

8de573bf-c0bf-4629-93fb-c53b6729b803
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.919
In this category,

af15c4e1-a908-4f1b-bc3e-7a0ad1798719
00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.917
whatever we put we provide in

eee96f88-87b4-4862-a993-1f448eda548b
00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:17.012
the input after some deley and

d069e85a-0554-40b7-ae66-6f8384d272e7
00:07:17.012 --> 00:07:19.114
this course you said that the

74e4515d-f2b5-4fd4-9643-189f1863dada
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.898
We can see the output or the result.

e7bfab2f-85ca-42dc-8f16-f49551db8c5e
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.313
Uh,

f10ddb1e-e2b9-44b5-afea-e7e65f4540a7
00:07:25.313 --> 00:07:27.791
and then we have another category

NOTE Confidence: 0.791691

a947dc55-5537-40d9-b62d-9fd25562e43d
00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:30.084
which we call sequential logic

NOTE Confidence: 0.791691

a61522c0-3438-43a3-b4d6-ae878d99987d
00:07:30.084 --> 00:07:33.000
which will cover in the future.

NOTE Confidence: 0.791691

7f96c1c9-a2b7-4caf-b96b-fe55e17b3c98
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.248
In the combination logic we make a

5f57358a-cc16-45af-bca8-d7eb3e1d0820
00:07:36.248 --> 00:07:39.238
category of based on the purpose of

26b673bd-df99-4061-a4d8-b5812c3ed3bd
00:07:39.238 --> 00:07:43.056
the unit up for the type of the task

68458eaf-38dd-46dd-87d5-e17d3ef5c7de
00:07:43.056 --> 00:07:46.493
that that digital unit wants to accomplish.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.217
So we said that we have coders.

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:18.090
So this is an exercise in the book,

501d8fdb-2c3f-4d32-b070-1f0c8ee74f20
01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:19.974

60d08142-dd54-4afa-a782-4daa3a23eccb
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:33.858
You input for instance the number in BCD,

cf74d9aa-44eb-42bd-814c-d2248f600214
01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.468
for instance 0101,

e28c5662-8a35-431e-9eb6-1c26915a3dd8
01:19:35.468 --> 01:19:39.220
which is the binary code for five.

02005d77-80bd-4b3a-b7f3-03bb0011cb50
01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:41.915
Now you have to turn on which

01:19:41.915 --> 01:19:44.701

d4ec22bc-f5bf-4938-8577-ce0c4948a260
01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:50.140
So you have to turn on this element

turn off this element so these elements

5c6ee8c7-b420-4d72-b5ff-8cdbc9ed3683

How can we do that?

af79ef1d-de5a-4dd5-acd7-eb183052b518
01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:05.630
This is a normal design for

How many variables in the output 7 outputs.

282e276a-cbb4-4c0f-bd80-eb250dab6f04
01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:15.436
So now you have 7 output functions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8465266

ea704990-530e-471b-be2a-e15ec9ea75f8
01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:18.436
You have to pick a name for

ABC, an, etc.

And then write Boolean expression for

d67acddc-a351-4dfa-9a09-de8e475c7a28
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:34.110
So you have five Boolean expressions.

fe80abfe-ea35-4d36-81f1-0fe6e09d36ec
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:36.792
You have to simplify each of

01:20:36.792 --> 01:20:39.980
them so you have 7 corner map.

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.080
And then you have to simplify

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.400
that and then design this second.

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:45.904
These are some examples.

if the input is the binary #0

5780ffed-a7ad-4792-a865-590b2dbe471a

01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:24.674
Basically I changed the key and

16eb748f-d7b7-4b96-9036-5c773858bb3f
01:29:24.674 --> 01:29:27.090
then I talked to them that.

4a3b2bbf-7dff-4079-bfc1-c17d0e3da365
01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:30.972
Whether any case that,

3e36cfca-5d68-40bb-9975-3042bde4a6f3
01:29:30.972 --> 01:29:32.481
uh, they deduce them,

a04410e9-b28f-47aa-ad98-9e09f2993cac
01:29:32.481 --> 01:29:34.743
or because of that or no,

01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:38.368
and then they will fix that.

01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:40.818
By now I I don't know,

09425e2a-e761-4676-bfe2-7b09afcf13a3
01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:43.690
but I hope it doesn't affect that.

01:29:43.690 --> 01:29:44.508
But anyways,

043ce919-4553-4416-9828-579e8d386100
01:29:44.508 --> 01:29:47.780
even if there is an effect on that,

01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:49.412
they will reverse that

be390712-d460-49a0-aa7c-66f293419efa
01:29:49.412 --> 01:29:51.452
or at the worst case,

b15ab2ef-7d5b-455e-af49-8ad98637c26a
01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:54.344
if you see that I will make

01:29:54.344 --> 01:29:56.369

01:30:00.516 --> 01:30:04.644
I will lose any mark about that, uh?

01:30:12.090 --> 01:30:16.828
F2. Correct for the F as well,

cd5bc747-f1d8-4716-89b6-7d7baec61ac4
01:30:31.018 --> 01:30:36.060
We have to add 2 as well, yes?

And the strange thing is that

01:31:05.230 --> 01:31:08.260
none of the markers actually.

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:16.672
they just look at the keys instead of

83c7c5bb-2ec5-4e7b-9b41-862efba1fb51
01:31:16.672 --> 01:31:20.199
checking the key and then start marking?

71f92654-6c94-473c-bdce-90738df6d49a
01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:23.480
