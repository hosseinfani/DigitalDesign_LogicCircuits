00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.088
So we call it flip flops so I can

00:14:50.662 --> 00:14:53.488
go and build our computer system.

67bf36df-393a-462a-a2fc-3a0ddf426bf6
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.242
So so far we had Rs memory unit

00:14:59.292 --> 00:15:02.663
the Rs was that whenever the input

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.908
so as long as the Enable is one,

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.820
we look at the inputs.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:14.909

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.030

73d19ba8-aca7-45fd-aa0e-e68b19bfc331
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:24.510
we just keep the initial state,

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.470
which is usually 0.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.640

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.176

But as you look at the changes to the Rs.

It is open as long as the enable input is 1.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.885
your internal is that going

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:14.529

ca8c26fb-2de5-48b8-ba6e-a71e49165bae
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.816
So, and this is not desired,

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.012
usually we want to change the internal

00:19:20.012 --> 00:19:23.707

00:19:23.707 --> 00:19:27.058
it up until the next enabled input.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.262
So the way this large works

NOTE Confidence: 0.834356

c834d78d-b68a-4209-b4c4-6abf3b0e6824
00:19:29.262 --> 00:19:31.270
is called working by level,

ae10abcf-3a1e-4209-8c17-182cdd972400
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.072
meaning that it works with the

00:19:34.072 --> 00:19:37.829
level of one for the enabled input.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.362
So the question is,

NOTE Confidence: 0.834356

70c172a5-ef0a-4533-aed9-3984dc6e93c8
00:19:39.362 --> 00:19:42.527
is it possible to build a memory unit

00:19:42.527 --> 00:19:46.340
that only look at the input at the moment,

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.896
not at the during the period

of time that E is 1.

190886be-dfe8-459c-9502-ab3783270d40
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.440
So instead of just having a time span,

NOTE Confidence: 0.834356

bb0284b4-eea9-4510-97ec-21c4b52d075d
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.490
we want to have just a quick moment of that.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.590
So here is the problem of the latch.

cee3cd36-2d41-47af-a1f4-35718a00ad95
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.390
So the latch is when they become

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.290
We want to make it a moment.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.738
I mean, if I want to,

67ef73b3-d3ef-4df5-af52-020741a5b6c1
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.444
I mean intuitively expand that it's kind of

9d930f66-c41c-4a85-bafd-6ade3709fe4f
00:20:20.444 --> 00:20:24.025
instead of having a door having a people.

87ad50ae-50cf-43e5-b402-293afd2bf2eb
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.870
So basically we don't want to open the

00:20:29.277 --> 00:20:31.757
to open the door and close the door,

235221ee-a6be-4a87-8bcf-de9c3aea4beb

So you just want to see what what

And that's enough for you to

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.310
So instead of just having the time span for

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.080
letting the latch open or the door open,

c9314163-4ca3-494d-8ca9-6cda0446871c
00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.340
So if you do that,

d90b7220-8425-457b-87f2-5109b3fdc1c1
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.237

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.025
So we basically say that the memory

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.381
So let's practice,

30a2b943-32bb-4747-8445-2bb8404ac0e8
00:28:27.381 --> 00:28:29.966
maybe this answers your question.

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:33.912
Imagine we have a memory unit

00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:37.929

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:45.142
So initially you said that you

1428ff56-5cba-4032-9569-fc023acaa102
00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.116
We see the first edge by edge.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.234
We mean that the transition for

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.976
So we see the first edge.

df405183-a9c6-49aa-bf2b-b7d80872b665
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:08.476
At this moment we just at the moment

00:29:14.028 --> 00:29:16.800
So this is the set it brings.

43a04bc9-de02-4ae8-9682-6ab07d2b35b8
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.242

so it goes to one and it keeps

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.372
So basically only look at the input

a3af5ab5-4670-49af-a1d7-ede77224258f
00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.300
So here or is 0, S is 1, it sets,

c0a89921-b7fc-40b7-864a-cf05d1bc53df
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:22.850
so it sets to one up until the next positive

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:27.304

b7d5afcb-681a-46ff-b9ee-691a4af54a1b
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.948
It drops to zero up until the next positive

fceaa5c6-3909-4239-ae4b-6ded629b097a
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.736
Usually we show it by this you put

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.786
which basically shows that this memory

00:39:17.786 --> 00:39:21.679
units works based on the negative edges.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.176
And, uh, the same example for

faaef543-86ef-4fd6-be10-750dd36e7c51
00:39:26.756 --> 00:39:28.846
the negative edge becomes this,

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:32.602
so we only look at the transition

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:46.242
So. You see here we had zero up

NOTE Confidence: 0.935806

05ae7844-61d8-4ddd-9fb2-f5e658ef6842
00:39:46.242 --> 00:39:49.439
until the next negative edge,

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.710
so any change to ordinas.

cc510c8b-1119-4a71-8ae0-d85366f65b82
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.824
Doesn't have any impact up until

facb3aeb-8dc2-4074-9d41-3c43e8dd51ad
00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.750
Or is zero as is 1?

NOTE Confidence: 0.935806

89e60cef-58f9-4125-8282-8bd5db8957f0
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.822
It becomes one up until the

61dba745-8bd1-43f2-9d81-fe56d72b088b
00:40:03.822 --> 00:40:06.690
next negative edge and attach.

NOTE Confidence: 0.935806

b63b373f-f5ec-4880-afcb-744157f69667
00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:10.106
So there is another way to say.

NOTE Confidence: 0.935806

698a7188-7bf4-42a7-89e4-a51f979ea147
00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:12.400
How the memory unit works.

NOTE Confidence: 0.935806

7d749dd9-2a2e-46bd-aa8a-ce088bb1209c
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.088
We call it triggering,

6a785379-37cb-4993-882a-983b8166fd7c
00:40:14.088 --> 00:40:17.420
so you may be heard about Trigger,

NOTE Confidence: 0.935806

9e260b34-9ec9-4743-b097-8f5d3708b758
00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:20.451
so he said that either the memory

c0e88bf1-1c64-40fc-a995-5c3e96ee34a1
00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:23.266
unit works based on the level

or level triggered memory unit,

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.546
or we have a edge triggered a memory

5cc795d0-c445-4a10-9da1-84aea394cfb7
00:40:28.546 --> 00:40:31.566
and so basically another word for

08c514fd-856f-4aee-b06f-e2bfcdb45614
00:40:31.566 --> 00:40:34.326
this behavior is called trigger.

bd58bb67-fa3b-440e-935c-a165ada8e499
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:41.788
So. The flip flops workspace on the

00:40:45.072 --> 00:40:47.568
call it edge triggered memory unit,

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.988
 but before voltage we had latches,

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:53.638
there were level triggered memory units.

cfecca1a-c7aa-4fd9-acef-aa9e31f4f55d
00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.188
And as we said, we have a

fd2d25ad-b598-42c2-aab6-408b198c4e99
00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:15.145
It means that this memory in it

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:40.566
We could build the latches by

00:41:40.566 --> 00:41:42.550
adding a gate enable input,

e73e0c2c-95cd-4637-8af1-5a2b6aadd400
00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:49.465

b75a5018-7872-49b5-9af6-0bee24d9cd54
00:59:56.716 --> 00:59:59.264
that doesn't have any input or output.

01:00:43.319 --> 01:00:45.290
because you don't have gates,

86c7d3bc-ad1e-4a78-93f7-3f4f0612c043
01:02:11.352 --> 01:02:15.260
we know that we have free flip-flops.

a45d8ad8-d7ba-43dc-af92-7418002353b1
01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.440
Because you have a block

So you have 3 flip flops.

af831d96-25f2-4efd-a0d2-cad113e44af5
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:31.665
Also you have feedbacks so

01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:39.299
Because the end of the one flip flop goes
