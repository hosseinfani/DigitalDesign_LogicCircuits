00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.772
So if you remember, we start

f3397996-f9ac-43af-8e01-962b4124ad30
00:01:34.772 --> 00:01:37.290
from the stars, we said that.

c1a15d6a-53cb-4356-9ebf-8ebcedabef7b
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.007
The human individual saw these stores and

46ad4187-026c-44c7-9b19-39e626a98e0d
00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:46.365
they wanted to travel to space to these

00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:50.050
stars and at that was the beginning of

ad0ce182-2279-4066-8d0c-0c9c7c8759b6
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.890
introducing some problems and solving

298f4562-6a7d-4564-8428-43c9ab28bcb5
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.210
those problems by using some machines.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.085
As a result, they wanted to build some

9b438445-2905-466c-b0c1-7103132d7a7f
00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:02.813
computer systems called them computer system

d6dc461a-ff3c-48f0-9ee9-40b63fc9902a
00:02:02.813 --> 00:02:07.310
that do some computation for them, etc so.

d7354fe3-c971-4ddc-a971-f13e009c4dda
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.254
That was the goal of the human individuals

266e5b72-9aa2-4bc0-b504-fc2b45289ff4
00:02:11.254 --> 00:02:14.853
to build some spacecraft from the

9e8dcb74-9b90-4b66-ad06-a3dfcdf42066
00:02:14.853 --> 00:02:18.621
earliest steps of developing some tools.

7e4c2f75-9c5a-4f9d-a0cf-0e85572f8496
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.946
So that was the beginning of

e67b2f11-6ff8-4e4e-8bb5-693183ca90f3
00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:23.130
our journey for this course.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.490
And so far we did the numbering system

NOTE Confidence: 0.878539

47d44414-f63f-425d-ae66-fec1bf24429b
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.376
which we need for any arithmetic or any

NOTE Confidence: 0.878539

4944e54e-2da8-4ea9-93d6-00ef00fe04c7
00:02:30.376 --> 00:02:33.006
calculation on for doing processing

5f03134e-fd8e-44b6-b25b-9ae8da1a14be
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:36.438
and providing some solutions to the

373abed8-affb-4fe5-9a32-f59fd53eecff
00:02:36.438 --> 00:02:40.855
problems and then in order to build a

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:44.290
machine we introduce some basic gates.

30fe14b1-2fe5-4994-8ece-26f48ccdad20
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.357
I will use the binary system because

00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:52.258
of the robustness of the such system.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.086
Because we have only two values.

NOTE Confidence: 0.878539

9be1d652-248e-4b30-b94c-e258a82b20a1
00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.858
And then we introduced some larger units

NOTE Confidence: 0.878539

3e35e44e-1553-4202-9e7d-4a1cc5b93776
00:03:00.858 --> 00:03:05.369
to do, for instance multiplication,

7a5bef3e-6083-4079-ab0e-5c768b0abe76
00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.228
subtraction and etc.

c8ab9cac-56c6-4629-94ef-1f9424ab0e35
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.507
And then we said that sometimes for

09ccc6ac-6cd6-407e-951b-68943f9843e5
00:03:12.507 --> 00:03:16.957
some purposes we need to store the

a29ddfe1-0e4a-464c-b450-b43504f71186
00:03:16.957 --> 00:03:20.695
intermediate results or we need to.

5c0ce007-4573-44c7-ba7c-9ae97080e554
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.514
Repeat some calculations in order to

33e3f43a-baf7-410e-8c66-2e446a5da4c6
00:03:23.514 --> 00:03:26.880
avoid multiple units of combination logic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.878539

2319d605-6e1a-46f3-bbe2-810011fd603a
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.352
We can reuse the output of the

00:03:30.352 --> 00:03:32.995
combination logic for another sequence

or another run of the unit,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.240
so that's why we introduced the

2dcbd001-16ad-4fe2-9f34-9f276b3725a8
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.270
sequential logic.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.690
We were the flip flops.

9f8506e8-8c82-48b0-86cd-7ea5bc9fcfed
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.046

fc06b61e-b8ae-483c-84fe-6febdc62b30b
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.986

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.035
we could build the calculators

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:33.140
by using the binary codes.

d1fa7bad-fc91-41b2-b39d-b90a5bab0757
00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:37.270
more complicated system,

7f14ed87-ddce-4dfd-a1a1-0cf7a2c66376
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.080
which we call a computer system.

fe40342b-dd3b-46d1-984c-adc330ebfe8a
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.778
We need to put a gate or latch.

ec4703b8-66a1-467d-b580-5aaf76fd0ad3
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.556
By introducing enable input,

00:05:30.556 --> 00:05:34.461
we could have an Rs unit with the large

And then we said that even the gate

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.544
So basically,

4e134e9d-be76-4979-8962-74c3cea4dfeb
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.160

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.949
as long as we have a positive edge flip flop,

7ff5cbc9-7241-431f-8068-bb71eaddb8d0

32d26370-4df4-416b-b15f-1c82babab5ba
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.620
Now we can build larger units

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.966
because we are given the circuit

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.092
We said that we can categorize

00:11:07.278 --> 00:11:09.358
into three main categories.

you could simply say that a.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.498
Because a is a name for that flip flop,

f89ad73e-b128-4779-8257-54e3ce48fa4e
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.830

00:19:39.155 --> 00:19:42.521
that need have only flip flops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84950495

7b5a4c68-92b4-45a7-b990-462235649c05
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.680
So very similar to the previous steps,

NOTE Confidence: 0.84950495

9fa62a73-4a38-4271-9ef5-20c2f00072e7
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.830
we go with the with an example.

29748e8a-12ff-430b-948d-ba760fd5474c
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.470
So if you follow these steps of the

682d84f1-289f-4e19-87ed-6a770a241c0a
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.766
example you can design any sequential

6df22a6b-9734-4add-aaad-d85db319b233
00:19:55.766 --> 00:19:59.192
circuit that has only flip flops.

fe74dad5-bcbe-40f2-a7d0-e7c71e7f1579
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.356
So he. Here is the example.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.524
The famous example counters.

2da4b5b0-7b79-4d3a-9ab1-9f6035cca94b
00:20:04.524 --> 00:20:08.944
So we want to design A circuit that

0d2af911-f2c2-44a3-a1a3-778b48d6fbb2
00:20:08.944 --> 00:20:13.192
does accounting from 02 N an would be

for instance a 1000 any decimal number.

f5160ce7-bbe1-42e9-8ba1-7bf07f529184
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:24.148
So the first question before starting the

NOTE Confidence: 0.89520216

f8d94ac6-8c77-4ab8-a8bc-413d70fad052
00:20:24.148 --> 00:20:29.015
design is that what type of circuit I need.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89520216

52524ad7-2bf6-4872-84f7-61b0f2388e21
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.726
I need a combination circuit or

NOTE Confidence: 0.89520216

b96c97a4-3a6f-4ddd-866c-341b6ce88058
00:20:31.726 --> 00:20:34.302
sequential circuit. So as you remember,

NOTE Confidence: 0.89520216

1d8e6042-6425-443d-b02d-90679baee026
00:20:34.302 --> 00:20:38.040
this was the question in the midterm exam,

8f00117f-f92d-4a93-a9a7-aa1dc1635916
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.974
then the last one of the

8475a48c-073f-46dc-9cf1-12b5edd7c2bc
00:20:40.974 --> 00:20:43.650
versions of the midterm exams.

4813ee98-f26d-4330-977f-9a5e5ac760bd
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.570
So at that time you had to design

NOTE Confidence: 0.89520216

eefcabf8-bba3-425e-b6a9-7d55461f9fd4
00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:49.459
it by a combination circuit.

29cc3182-cd2a-4470-9ebb-866f97f9c777
00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.028
But based on what we said in the

04434909-2190-43c2-be50-982d7b1d3613
00:20:53.028 --> 00:20:56.109
introduction for the sequential circuit.

ee83083f-8522-47df-9f6d-791c82a790c1
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.035
If you want to design the counter

11d6fa8e-d928-4da3-8538-d9a025570e7d
00:20:58.035 --> 00:21:00.119
based on the combination circuit,

787c3bad-17d5-479d-8e00-541cf8cb8b22
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.784
if you start counting from zero to 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89520216

828574e2-5f9f-477d-97ae-220c349280a5
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:07.000
And then you have to start from one to two.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89520216

9e6d6b99-ff73-4791-939c-3631a9cd3b34
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.584
You have to put the whole design.

84bd158c-fad8-4c8a-a8cc-72c717a450f4
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.038
So if this is the combination circuit you

1d8edcba-71be-4c85-9311-6fc0aaf9c8a3
00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:15.645
have to input zero and your output one.

7dda39ac-175b-4190-9b9c-f500a4af3bb9
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:19.439
And now if you go if you want to go to two,

6e272f5b-3868-4d45-a0ef-f016b27f94d5
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.330
you have to. Repeat that design.

53ae8122-9f8d-4239-a86a-c6fdca613408
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.226
Put one and then out with two an

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.559

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.288
you have to put.

Which is not an efficient design.

702d22a7-b10b-4bc3-901c-70e46ece47df
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:46.639
So now we want to use the sequential circuit.

5ee9b2f4-66d2-457d-b41d-af6617c5111a
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.970
So whenever you need to.

ab8e8fd1-e3ff-4d23-b221-412e3649120c
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.086
Store some intermediate results,

or whenever you feel like you need

ec7c1fc3-1e15-4f5f-9045-86817181fe86
00:21:56.753 --> 00:21:59.776
a memory unit, you are indirectly

adcb2e02-9b76-421d-b5a9-b6dc784afbdd
00:21:59.776 --> 00:22:03.990
saying that you need a sequential circuit.

3b984b9f-7e22-4998-93bf-623abd547a96
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.274
So this is the.

00:22:06.274 --> 00:22:09.129
As at the first step.

7141225c-420a-41e4-9c98-0ad434cbe284
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.140
If you need a memory,

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.940
you have to design A sequential circuit.

2a89d113-c6a0-4d6a-9a31-13dfdb3ddd0f
00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.396

f7c346d9-c472-4d0e-bca2-461197c55da4
00:22:19.822 --> 00:22:21.894
counter based on the sequential

circuit or based on the memory?

c68b08c8-3338-4610-9609-93840dda024c
00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.820
Because I can store the intermediate result

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.858

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:36.130
I can install one and then I can count to 2.

next step I found two goes to three.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.918
Without repeating the circuit.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.500
so I want to count from zero to N and

00:22:52.611 --> 00:22:56.355

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.234
To do this, I need to store I somewhere.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.939
And then at the next step I just increment

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.210
And so we need a memory.

c0d72be0-abf9-48d4-be5c-de1e06737349
00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:32.018
So that's why we need a sequential circuit.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.180
now that you need a memory,

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.708
So the question is that how many flip

so we are our memory unit gonna

edef84ab-aa1f-480f-beaf-98180241d257
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.893

00:25:06.385 --> 00:25:07.930
we need a sequential circuit.

The second question,

00:25:08.854 --> 00:25:10.702
if we need a sequential circuit,

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.866
it means that we need the memory,

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.460
It depends on the number of flip flops.

00:25:18.603 --> 00:25:21.500
because we are counting from zero to 7,

abbe83ed-ac16-4318-bae1-59b56be028a0
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.541

c91857cb-c943-42ce-8e13-be4c9c7a4ee6
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.249
We have we need 3 flip flops so in

So because we said that we need 3 flip flops.

5eb099b4-caa1-46fe-9a49-f9f0623cfea5
00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.653
So each flip flop can I store 1 bit,

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.160
this way we need another memory unit

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:20.238
So you see, a is a flip flop.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:56.770
you can design the circuit.

we reach the final state,

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:36.685
But when you choose the flip flops,

d2eda7ad-2aee-47cb-90af-ae22b65f902a
00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.180

If you do compliment, one becomes 0.

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:26.250

01:15:55.408 --> 01:15:58.264
You have to do for instance

4bfa0c18-1edb-428a-a133-184ce1766da1
01:15:58.264 --> 01:16:00.578
based on the D flip flop.

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:03.860
It depends on the type of sequential circuit.

c0c7d0d4-cbd6-43ab-bd64-0ef5bc247490
01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:06.948

b29d84fa-aa5b-416f-9886-7020b4f9b23a
01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.528
We usually use D flip flop,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8775756

1d187086-ef05-46b3-8c33-7abd1bf03f48
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:14.570

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:18.034
the input goes directly to the flip flop.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.940
For the counters we usually use jakar.

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:25.190
Or sometimes she flip flopped

01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:28.639
Flip Flop is also a good choice.

19d70823-9c5e-429a-83e0-2337ffd7086f
01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.971
But the flip flop is not usually

d2946ab7-3813-45d0-8b28-4a5dd7a6388f
01:16:30.971 --> 01:16:32.720
used for the counters.

995adc17-22b9-416a-8dbe-7c802aa581e7
01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.220
Based on my experience.

09d0ca8c-3ccd-4ac8-a398-9b7f8a8bfb13
01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:38.356
Or as Flip Flop is also years,

334b461a-92e7-46f7-94fa-cd0103c246f7
01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:41.510
but because Rs flip flops has forbidden

891aeca1-6550-42c9-9142-1bad84d90553
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:44.880
actions, so usually jeka is preferable.

c34cc65b-31b3-47d0-8eb0-a332a71c5112
01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.600
I mean compared to Rs.

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:54.780
But at home, try to design the same

01:16:57.366 --> 01:17:00.339
that it is also a better design.

c97f87dc-2655-465e-b70a-67d279623a4f
01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.388

d35e47fa-bc5c-4213-b708-64c27a4ddf31
01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.200
It's very simple although.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.216
You need a lot of simplification.

e740f517-d636-4e8c-ad15-5cc6e4fa7014
01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:20.579
A lot of corner map and etc.

83efcc67-2293-48eb-961d-cc460db45842
01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:22.428
It takes a longer time for

01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:27.076
but the final circuit is very simplified

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:30.116
so only one and an flip flip flops.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.590

ca56be19-5df0-420e-a719-66b5ddc6529f
01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:46.604
because for the D or T you need
