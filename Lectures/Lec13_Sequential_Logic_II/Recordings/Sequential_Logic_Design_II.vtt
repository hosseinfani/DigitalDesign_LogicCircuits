00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.810
Very similar to our course that

fddbf57b-74be-435c-bb1d-d219e5338c08
00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:43.709

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.007

00:03:08.481 --> 00:03:11.052
after perficient you have to consider

cf3d3b92-a1bb-4120-a30c-a7375009e0b7
00:03:11.052 --> 00:03:13.901
the sequence and you have to attach

04820e05-097f-40aa-ae0d-bfb470843646
00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:16.930
the start and end of each sequence of

b0f9c62b-8206-44a9-81e7-aba28a1c2302
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.286
the movie without which you cannot

e3b03f22-a432-4a0c-91df-215dcb2e67a5
00:03:19.286 --> 00:03:21.306
understand what are these story.

419582a9-a64c-4dc9-9ef9-8dcf33759a9f
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.340
What is the story so?

3a3f3a61-599d-4adb-8987-9e1df8e1bd48
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.916
And also it adds more complexity,

99778c8a-c9aa-4add-a153-b1110c294fbc
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.874
so that's why I need your full

25564d45-b437-4623-bc8d-a63732451ff5
00:03:33.016 --> 00:03:35.176
with the first category sequential

472c0739-9de8-43cb-9a13-6cb36531c3a1
00:03:35.176 --> 00:03:37.628
logic that only have flip flops.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.257
And now today we are going to discuss the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8547249

a7ca766d-b138-432d-9aee-3ff95b57916f
00:03:41.257 --> 00:03:45.007
other two categories flipped up with inputs.

58eb0e1a-2a65-4078-a9ba-5f6f300dd439
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.027
And Flip flop with inputs and outputs.

d07f7a26-455e-4999-91cb-a171391398d9
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.872
So instead of just explaining each of

2b806ee6-003e-40f1-80c3-7b4271a76dc9
00:03:50.872 --> 00:03:53.630
these two categories in separate sections,

4cd40a45-e402-47d2-ada3-c0cd1f3af80f
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.402
I want to explain the flip flop

b2580f48-4496-4355-977e-84dbe70377b8
00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:59.049
with input and output which covers

4e6485c0-fd25-4e48-ba36-1cacf2fb2ed3
00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.241
the flip flop with input as well.

3039b79c-5c6b-4bba-80c0-7397d26dbec4
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.932
So basically I'm going to explain

NOTE Confidence: 0.8547249

ec018a42-b1d6-41fb-b655-55ad4b47c81e
00:04:04.932 --> 00:04:07.192
this category which already covers

bfbda332-0abb-421f-9422-9ba49cbf5d18
00:04:07.192 --> 00:04:09.147
this category as well so.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.390
What is the analysis and design

0c64f48b-a844-4054-98dc-d7434b8a588d
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.029
of a sequential circuit where not

83c7fa2e-3925-4012-80e2-e89ecd210b1a
00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.797
only we have a flip flops as in

NOTE Confidence: 0.84465045

2bcf31ec-d311-4d46-b9df-ab206c09e549
00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.019
memory of the circuit, but also we

969766c5-5195-433a-9912-c3092eebb60f
00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:27.557
have some inputs and some outputs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84465045

46e82389-66f0-4650-bb7c-6a4e7ffce87b
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.082
Kind of mixture of the combination

c6e47368-333f-42fe-959f-e370aff6d424
00:04:31.082 --> 00:04:34.130
logic and the sequential logic.

567b4d29-09b8-48d2-af30-5c27d8943a0b
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.220
So as we already said,

NOTE Confidence: 0.84465045

7515126f-743d-455b-be00-8f5472d02902
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.316
analysis means that we are given a circuit

e292964f-e47b-47a7-991c-5b2f850a9f01
00:04:39.316 --> 00:04:42.466
and we have to analyze the behavior.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84465045

2f0ec55f-87e2-4b06-b0aa-2e7475439ac8
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.403
So basically have to form the state

00:04:45.403 --> 00:04:47.889

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.980
Which is kind of easier,

e0e7116b-a3bb-4f45-b22f-e9689f95cd31
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.899
but the design is the reverse procedure.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.164
We are given a problem and we have

a7c7b220-d464-4807-8ef6-17c16034b7eb
00:04:56.164 --> 00:04:59.147

950ae7a4-c921-4a79-ae90-02a5bf5b521a
00:13:41.822 --> 00:13:44.516
outputs based on the more model.

8cadfd63-bbd2-4674-aebc-e4d436cca802
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.700
So what are these changes?

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

05ecc86a-265f-4f63-9eb3-bb7ec8379c17
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.940
So I'm going to explain the changes

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

3d23c92b-c7b3-4878-a091-be5e3a0c8af8
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.530
by an example as the way we did

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

c386fa38-68c5-4bb5-b89b-4c8a41e47800
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.095
for the analyzing the circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

720664d1-188a-4349-a449-c9de33a69481
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.450
This flip flops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

5f0e2430-86cb-47c5-ab89-7891f1ced177
00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.059
So here is the circuit that are given

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

dac48a8e-6e62-4c5c-9e60-bcc07f7cbf5f
00:14:00.059 --> 00:14:03.344
to us and we are asked to do the.

e0facbea-22a4-431e-95fa-975a05050e74
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:06.868
Analysis. So first and foremost,

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

7e405820-003a-470c-a254-c00569010c1b
00:14:06.868 --> 00:14:08.703
as we said the question,

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

7aa9e7f8-7f67-47d4-ba70-273288add7e0
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.966
the first question is that are

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

a72c74a9-d4c3-464e-acee-5c6472d89251
00:14:10.966 --> 00:14:13.214
we dealing with a sequential

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

001b20a4-e41f-45b4-8e3a-f2d0a1214315
00:14:13.214 --> 00:14:15.850
circuit or combination circuit?

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

72208023-feae-4da1-9379-c2e8b6bba675
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.642
So we said that as long as

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

f0be7525-0386-4d69-b94a-d9a07ed4f381
00:14:17.642 --> 00:14:19.769
if there is at least one flip

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

77766ed7-c9e1-42a4-b616-99e1e2ac3628
00:14:19.769 --> 00:14:21.707
flop or at least one feedback,

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

ffc1861d-9b99-4500-8a03-9232879e63b3
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.398
we're dealing with this sequential circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

28a68898-862a-47f9-a6ab-dc362f15a978
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.880
So if you back if you go back to the circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

73bbc601-306c-4043-a37f-eae538663717
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.429
So we have one flip flop here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

3bb4642d-85a0-432d-a84e-cedc265e6ad9
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:33.492
Of type T.

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

c371067e-6fdf-4492-a077-fdc6187e8f3c
00:14:33.492 --> 00:14:35.970
Another flip flop of Type J car.

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

2a9c41ce-38e9-4297-b2b2-d4880f7d22ad
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.252
So as a result we are dealing

NOTE Confidence: 0.864523

7f7366c2-d1b8-467d-9acf-832c4e47b237
00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:39.860
with a sequential circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

82c35022-2e1e-4d7f-a127-84bf56525913
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.368
So and also we have one feedback here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

6daf57a4-a99e-4405-872b-380d33fa9eaa
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.550
So here is the feedback from

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

d2abafcf-b82f-4bba-a7b6-1d5651d0570b
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.240
the JCAR to the T flip flop.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

19bf15b9-01be-4143-a6b6-56b010509321
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.075
So the answer to the first question is we

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

1a2e93d0-b86a-4d68-b9fc-08a709e24884
00:14:56.075 --> 00:14:58.846
are dealing with a sequential circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

d64d0f47-0f36-4a49-855f-6ae4b26e5a6e
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.974
So after we found that we

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

e94b7cc6-19c8-469c-90a2-dc5099287b34
00:15:00.974 --> 00:15:02.390
have a sequential circuit,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

fb113ae2-c59b-4de0-a9e7-29fd63d76cc1
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.206
the next step is what are the flip flops?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

d5df411e-6dd5-45e2-8a49-9e1f47b6a024
00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:09.570
 So as I said, we have a free flow of JK

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

657ba212-ccfc-43df-a7be-092595f7ed7c
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.620
so we said that we pick a name for that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

cbc1adbd-5234-4522-b52c-76a5973b1a0a
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.600
Imagine we pick a name a for this flip flop

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

7385657b-a8db-450a-a9e5-de7916aa3366
00:15:16.694 --> 00:15:20.490
and for the T flip flop we pick a name B.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

35bbfab0-70ab-42d9-abe0-5dfb213e5a3f
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.890
So these are the names of the flip

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

dce8df5e-ec33-477f-8cf8-d793c122ac0f
00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.575
flops and we note the type of the flip

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

c0d392a5-9c2c-4f13-9b3c-9dc6bc5a2071
00:15:25.575 --> 00:15:27.570
flops just to remember the actions

NOTE Confidence: 0.7724075

fe86e84c-3ef1-4664-9741-2bfbb8603f87
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.055
to the input of the flip flops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

9d91f4b2-0351-4cfe-9240-4f3d4dd7b6f7
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.504
And then the next is what are these

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

52af4e11-b2e9-4554-8a0b-defa2966ccce
00:15:35.504 --> 00:15:38.346
states of the whole circuit based on

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

44f7d397-9c0f-4e4e-9575-0e180974ee38
00:15:38.346 --> 00:15:41.867
2 flip flops we are going to have each

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

7002ae20-34f8-4c99-a1cd-e7586b889231
00:15:41.867 --> 00:15:45.357
flip flop so the T flip flop gonna have

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

4988ee78-874a-45a6-b979-0b2b1af734a1
00:15:45.357 --> 00:15:48.430
either zero or one two states multiplied

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

26ce0803-907d-43f6-9e74-35048f8d23ab
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:51.407
by the a flip flop which is a jaycar.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

ee916e5a-7431-4e5c-9d9b-480b4872e603
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.085
Flip flop as twisted multiplied by two.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

9e9e0cd3-4037-477b-ad49-63ac923a3c2f
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:59.878
So four estate, however, in this design.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

7a0ae51a-0b0c-4278-b0fc-5acedbb443a3
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.936
As you can look closely to the circuit,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

15d1ec2c-941e-4109-b734-33712c14a52c
00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.167
you can see that this another input.

a32c6138-a7b0-4efe-b854-6575cb67a264
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.910
To the whole circuit.

d761124d-b47e-430f-ab7c-fcb10710f752
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:12.130
So that's the change to the type of analysis.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

bba1688e-882c-49a9-89cd-4f1977fee376
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.188
Previously we only had flip flops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

ce30c40e-3db9-496d-81cb-f6ec02561c0d
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.862
There were no inputs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

3a806738-d2c5-4ed2-997e-9a62835aff6a
00:16:15.862 --> 00:16:18.370
The only inputs was the Clock.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

bc00dfc6-3680-402d-baae-8088ec240171
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.395
So the Clock is just for triggering

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

fb4fe008-2e5a-4551-bae2-a93f4332ffa3
00:16:22.395 --> 00:16:24.503
the flip flops. However,

1d7a8615-7d2e-406c-accd-b48fa30dac67
00:16:24.503 --> 00:16:27.567
in this circuit you see another input X,

dc78b06a-c3a9-4b21-b811-ead50b8d2ae7
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.832
which goes inside the circuit and

b575f143-72ea-429f-b2bc-b878eedf6ffc
00:16:29.832 --> 00:16:32.549
has an impact on the flip flops.

3daf9161-3ce5-4b43-aac0-d832428b990a
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.070
Once X goes here.

f581a293-eb1c-4e34-901e-dc65144b8dc4
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.311
An the value of X has an influence

19c6d12e-e2a0-405f-80eb-49e589d51b00
00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:39.466
on the input of T.

91217e7e-62e8-4649-90ec-7533444d60e7
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.730
Also, this X comes here.

e9986749-7f9a-4b0c-802d-f93f73c2f795
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.402
And it has an impact on the input

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

304f6794-600b-41fa-8c35-330889cea558
00:16:44.402 --> 00:16:46.927
of J for the a flip flop.

79bf3ff1-fd00-43a2-b869-0a559723675c
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:50.322
So the value of X has an influence

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

675626c0-e6cd-449d-bf74-24ec2ba3ae52
00:16:50.322 --> 00:16:52.309
or has an impact.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.646
So we have to consider this as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

79858aa4-4870-4ece-8752-8f612941e057
00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.569
So because you have only one input,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

3a8bd694-be23-4db8-94da-ce38752844a9
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.898
this X input might be zero or one,

b789727d-9fb0-4462-943d-8078febd7296
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.985
so this binary variable gonna

bb1bbfe3-c5ac-43cf-96f5-08ae6f250f79
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.906
So two values of the input,

bc5c97ea-6788-46af-929d-3bf82c9bb21f
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.220
So either X is 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

6bd3dde7-cde6-4885-8c18-76e705ab7583
00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.820
T flip flop is 0 J Kise Zero or X.

fbf12242-7da3-4d9c-b4e1-9c05c0fb4321
00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.500
IS0T is 1, jaykar is zero and etc.

cd5a9dae-9089-4ff1-a12c-758a2e0d6d48
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.616
So in total we're going to have

bd8e8d18-86ea-48ca-b829-00ee72ce9e5c
00:17:41.616 --> 00:17:44.440

d966fa31-3fa0-4a1c-bf0c-c9ce7f2e5530
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:44.852
So.

5ad1fe25-9ef0-4bf7-9986-dab02fc38760
00:17:44.852 --> 00:17:46.088
That's the change.

00:17:46.088 --> 00:17:49.120
Not only you have to consider the

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.437
so we're going to have the number

9f36e0c9-9e23-44ea-a31f-26edde686c18
00:18:01.437 --> 00:18:04.579
of flip flops plus number of inputs

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

5450b4c7-76af-4d97-b0eb-c247e3ac74ef
00:18:04.579 --> 00:18:07.830
to the power of three or eight.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

6f1f0867-e9eb-43c9-8dfa-3dee16155b47
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.217
So after we figure out the diff,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

484e88b9-e456-439a-95ba-0c1fc6005d11
00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.700
I mean all the possible estate of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

762d7dc0-bf0f-4302-b58a-8c618c9a1ffd
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.760
circuit. Same as in previous analysis.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

aaeaaaec-74ad-4077-ae0a-d78e29228947
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.995
We have to form the state table.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

3adef2cf-45da-44d9-b6c6-2065a95aa45c
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.710
So for this state table,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

bacd79ce-8c35-4dab-8d72-bafbf1152d32
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:26.658
as before, we have to create.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

3ef7bd75-7f9d-4a13-934c-b2050e83f256
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.100
One column for each flip

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

9ffe5d79-988a-4ab8-8d6f-2de65cb00e62
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.540
flop for the correct state.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

5fb2083e-2193-4aba-aa03-64566eaef512
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.706
One column for each flip flop

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

b5597d1d-8736-4142-9193-fc8794c3a617
00:18:33.706 --> 00:18:35.150
for the next step.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

a34e3cfd-48ce-4850-a66d-7896b82254cd
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.316
So as you can see here,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

41d5e473-c0ea-4096-9675-cc341f2da751
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.660
this part and this part is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

48cc2867-4211-4686-8258-63a51e8924c2
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.549
exactly the same as when we don't

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

cf74eca1-fa96-4f17-a13b-4548d68f0480
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:44.614
have any input or output.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

a8fb5ce4-c12a-473c-8287-d8fdc2717812
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.528
Very similar.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

8470fa1a-d4ab-44c8-8f94-e6c2fd36b395
00:18:45.528 --> 00:18:49.790
So the only minor changes here is the input.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

b71a34a2-55d7-4715-ad1a-829eefb11f19
00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:53.174
So you have to include one column for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

763f2f50-35c2-42d4-8297-0e441dbbdbed
00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.769
the different values of the input.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

6a572078-d35e-4171-ad4b-fb03b7945f6d
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.893
So in total in the left side of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

41c8c644-f8df-44c7-a0e6-416d48c3fb63
00:18:58.893 --> 00:19:02.028
table you have the current value of

c14ac437-623e-41de-9303-0987d35ff937
00:19:02.028 --> 00:19:05.189
the flip-flops plus the value of input.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

2c1316d4-ba97-4ec2-af17-106c4963649f
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.538
In the right side.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

c81eeb96-2814-4b6c-bbe2-94052e3127de
00:19:06.538 --> 00:19:08.968
So if we separate the table by

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

816d26cf-c8d9-46b0-be1b-4399ada7da9d
00:19:08.968 --> 00:19:10.918
this line in the right side,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

9180253f-68f7-4d7f-a2c1-79c9fd154e7b
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.158
we have the values of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032181

281a7443-ef4a-4b37-a143-2d67b8a36049
00:19:13.158 --> 00:19:14.650
flip flop for the

8b2939dd-b3c3-4eef-8b83-e612f2377c85
00:19:14.744 --> 00:19:15.700
next state.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

ab7d0289-bd51-4dfe-9183-478235b47ab1
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.508
And if you look closely to the circuit,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

dace942a-87e6-49fa-ad52-2958d95b988c
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.674
you can see that there is another.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

6a884b98-daee-47a2-b2a6-17ac51f4a76c
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:26.000
Output to the circuit which we call it F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

9302e3cc-c2f8-46f2-bc62-b968bb905382
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.968
So the main output of this flip flop

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

8e80b0dc-8c39-439e-8254-b39a63de14b8
00:19:28.968 --> 00:19:32.136
here is Q, the second output is Q bar,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

e82523ad-db34-4475-82aa-09bb159d4aae
00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.036
so the output of flip flops and just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

d4a2f93b-1c4d-4f49-b0a1-a0d25d5d583c
00:19:35.036 --> 00:19:38.052
we don't consider them as the Apple

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

2c8983af-824c-4c1f-8caf-c6919cb72c96
00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:41.153
of the circuit because these are just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

382d2f5a-0234-4fe5-bb67-0ae44c451a92
00:19:41.153 --> 00:19:43.967
showing the state of the flip flops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

aec59b23-16dd-4fe9-b07f-5c957a1130f9
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.112
But here you can see that there

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

ed50622a-9eaa-4872-960f-6b213cc2e01b
00:19:46.112 --> 00:19:48.040
is another output to the circuit,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

2276a545-a29d-4a4c-a6e1-83c5e0f32f72
00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.930
so you have to choose a name for that F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

b8787d65-3fe1-4305-8ba2-105303029468
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.270
And then you have to consider

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

5768aed7-5802-4d77-874a-3663cc64b043
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.320
what are the value of F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

66dd0462-b667-4557-a2f9-c0843a38cbde
00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.234
Based on the value of the input to the.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

ec723ac3-6abf-4538-b01a-2fb34149d0a0
00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.748
So if you see if you see

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

5f64de9f-dfc3-495f-bb2f-85fe481734bd
00:20:05.748 --> 00:20:10.610
F is end of two inputs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8726599

00ca2c1e-dc9c-4584-a29d-cb51d8bad8f1
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.336
The first input comes from the output of a.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83354837

a43e5f1e-d42b-49c4-b077-7e90d93ca0b6
00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:22.675
The second input comes from the output of B.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83354837

32831786-d45e-48e2-86ac-3a60c7f76299
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:29.860
So basically F is A&B but A&B are flip flops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83354837

d8346220-677f-42b6-a2c8-3a3db852e5bd
00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.540
So now you can see that it's a more model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83354837

6ab9b6b6-b3f6-48bc-99c2-f93d25acaf55
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.476
Why? Because F doesn't depend on the X,

NOTE Confidence: 0.83354837

afc2b5cf-fcea-40f2-ba69-b0a810b81169
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.792
it only depends on the value of flip flops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83354837

c343c1cc-2356-4497-82d3-220979ef8490
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.369
That's why we call this more model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8725506

cf400efa-8e5a-4db2-8859-6cc2401592ec
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:45.910
So here is the state

NOTE Confidence: 0.8725506

04393657-8ff9-4fbe-a0f8-b002c4c5cff1
00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:46.960
table and a minor change.

5469bdd6-5a76-42f1-a08e-1699ae968363
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.536
So in the left side you have to

53b79ed0-333c-404c-8d15-d6fac3445e15
00:20:48.536 --> 00:20:49.841
include the input in the right

00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:51.370
side you have to include the app.

6a9e1793-dc61-4a27-9ae9-cb46ee8072e4
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:52.420
If there is an app.

dc8f9c2f-788b-4874-85c6-68f731b69a71
00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.580
And then, uh, oh,

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

1c29add3-dacb-4d4b-9696-326a9b0a8445
00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.388
there's another way to show the state

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

cfdf4e7a-d6d0-4081-8962-4a2792f49e07
00:20:59.388 --> 00:21:02.279
table when you have input an output?

2b7c846e-771b-4f38-b502-1c59cabe0742
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.290
I don't like this way,

9474a0f0-fe23-403c-a2d2-693021e7c441
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.300
but just for your information,

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

7874cb05-c853-4137-88f0-d56ebd049c89
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.140
one way is this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

7c1d96b3-2ee0-4577-a207-d76b716187b6
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.431
You can have the correct current value

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

45a78ece-e514-421d-b81a-b5615ff6af27
00:21:11.431 --> 00:21:14.855
of the flip flops in the left side.

34774d99-bcad-4850-825d-4ee450e886fa
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.010
In the right side you can determine

1fa133c3-a380-4db4-b9f6-71d02c67fbca
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.708
the value of flip flops for the next.

56d4fbfb-4780-48a4-855d-85a9e59a0be1
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.007
State based on the value of X.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

11f7a325-ec21-4e68-b69d-661c7cb36432
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.494
So basically just distributing the value

7ae4bd1c-6f6d-4257-ad40-12355084e2a4
00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:31.000

cb7bd271-edfe-4073-b8ae-c827d9b678f1
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.394
So basically you can say that

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

b4243116-cd59-4a09-8941-b567385e6cbb
00:21:33.394 --> 00:21:37.238
for the next state, if X is 0.

76f3ecf8-85fa-4a75-9371-f8211f090dcf
00:21:37.238 --> 00:21:39.486
These are the values.

e64561b8-ce9a-4579-945d-27570daf829c
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.146
For the next step, if X is 1,

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

e877e256-7924-4ff7-aee6-80ca401bb794
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.758
these are the values.

c36017f7-4631-4c54-9c41-3432a30300c8
00:21:44.758 --> 00:21:46.714
And because F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

357a9fce-d3c1-46fe-add1-90af31494fec
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.800
Doesn't depend on X,

331f0c67-7729-4f28-a3a8-e467329831d6
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.719
so you don't have to distribute X on F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

e0c6e103-9431-431a-b5b6-d3665fe3f8dc
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.900
So F is only one single.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

4d715db3-3101-4fff-9d0f-632bf9058a69
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.544
If you do this,

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

f36a843f-6814-4684-9ef6-838a488ff827
00:21:57.544 --> 00:22:00.010
the number of rows are eight,

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

5174b989-31ff-4e74-95ce-ca4acd0d8566
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:03.298
just depends on the different value of A&B.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80236506

a3fdee9b-e0b7-4e82-ad3b-43ee51014baf
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.350
Because you distribute X here,

cd896f94-163d-4a58-958b-bacffaa817d4
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.410
so you add more columns,

13bf819d-878c-4c1a-9510-ada295878bdb
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.465
but the previous figure because

b16d87d5-10de-4c8b-8973-94ea7348d410
00:22:09.465 --> 00:22:12.343
you have a B&X, you're going to

dc1e002d-85a1-4624-b21d-acfd57f7652f

but in this design you're

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.450
going to have four rows.

don't need the other bugs.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.160
Instead, you have more columns,

ca27ed18-df32-4538-853b-adf27bee5f13
00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.850
so it depends on your.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.250
I prefer this way because

45ef28de-cac0-498e-b2e0-410c6b751591
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:47.759
it's more, I mean, simpler.

ae44baab-7066-49e1-ab51-23050fd17eb1
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.697
So now we know how to form the state

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.256
so only one column for inputs.

7ea62d31-a08a-4d64-98a2-d75afc1ccef6
00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.760
If you have two inputs,

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.902
you have to add 2 columns and

c9243eac-b6f1-4b61-97f2-a8ce73ea81cd
00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.856
And then you have to start

00:23:13.856 --> 00:23:15.280
filling the state table.

49961731-fad5-4daa-8aab-1186e6ecea7b
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.080
So now let's see what is going

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.685

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.234
Very similar to the time that

flip flops are already all the possibilities,

00:23:38.664 --> 00:23:41.016
But this time you have input,

7edb367c-95cd-4925-8038-c168e3feabca
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.378
so you have to consider the

00:23:43.378 --> 00:23:44.950
different values of X.

dedaca2b-7642-413b-b366-a141a121e310
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.086
So if X is either zero or one,

f61f3105-835b-4692-98cf-270f383ff2d3
00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.055
so you're going to have

00:23:50.055 --> 00:23:52.020
000 and then 1/2 answers.

0173a800-fe0a-44bb-9f69-30bd7b5690cd
00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.560
As you can see,

decc3942-09b2-4b98-beb1-34c902e0dcaf
00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.529
these are the midterm 0 up until mid term 7.

f2cd38a9-f983-4bd6-a349-891f5d7390eb
00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.060
But look at the difference.

48ae117e-4d3e-438d-9571-562aae0de43f
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.148
X is not a flip flop, it's an input

00:24:06.148 --> 00:24:09.620
binary variable AB is a flip flop.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.015
So be careful about the I mean,

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:16.890
the type of the value.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.500
Very similar to previous analysis.

9a8ff6fe-ab36-47cf-adec-b83a1743cac2

c9d6a243-0310-4215-bd22-79ad48d86e28
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.467
The easiest part is about the output

5fa5bf2a-0300-4b7d-a052-422c25ef7acc
00:24:32.467 --> 00:24:35.648
because we are dealing with the more

00:24:38.841 --> 00:24:42.457
on the current value of the flip flops,

9de4af7d-ba42-4392-be2e-f7ffd4222a78
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.572
so F is A&B.

bda3000b-823e-4d25-a69c-4a4fca11cb3f
00:24:44.572 --> 00:24:49.759
So if A&B are 00A and B becomes 0.

b7267e7c-cbd3-48a9-9fa0-e43ca06341c6
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:55.030
If A is 1B is 0, the end is 0 an etc.

f9f21e40-9c10-42ce-97cf-67feef1f915c
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.658
So all these values are planted.

71e54677-0d3d-4c67-a5a5-6b97945910c1
00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:03.124
Here A is 1B is 1, so F becomes one.

0a00f33d-3af7-431d-bb93-c0480c478abb
00:25:03.124 --> 00:25:07.360
And then 000 and then one.

939beec7-a7f1-4a8a-8d6b-fab57d2e2707
00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.497
So you see,

f3a4d02b-cb69-4e48-8130-090717571e50
00:25:08.497 --> 00:25:10.771
the output is very simple and

ccaefadd-702d-4170-85f2-171587593a25
00:25:10.771 --> 00:25:13.465
because it's based on the more model.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.780
So X is not involved.

0f8883e6-2750-431a-bdee-bddce6613cb1
00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.182
You can imagine that if this circuit

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.358
Then you have to have kind

not only flip flops but also

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.152
So then you have to consider

e5e0ca1c-38d1-443b-bdbc-45aab5c8d402
00:25:37.152 --> 00:25:38.839
the value of X as well.

00:25:40.424 --> 00:25:42.190
only the value of flip flops.

0e7f0207-03a0-414f-8fbf-ed9e0bed5ed5
00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.694

00:25:51.094 --> 00:25:53.229
what are the value of A&B.

ded02efe-4d3f-4f69-8d05-b28af82af48c
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.136
The only difference here is that now a

00:25:59.136 --> 00:26:03.198
the next value of a not only depends on

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:10.755
But also it depends on the value of XY,

550fce8e-1dc5-4ba8-b2dd-cf7fea1ecaac
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.872
because X has an influence on

00:26:12.872 --> 00:26:15.210
the input of the flip-flops.

0d1a0b1d-efa8-4c1c-bcc8-2d21288aecb6

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.597

2fee147f-b784-44f5-a2cf-374bb3eca28e
00:26:38.929 --> 00:26:41.478
because it's a J car flip flop.

72ebe5ec-b9e7-41ed-bf70-38f5c61eb824
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.056

so J IS0K is 1 reset, so you're

cabcff83-e94e-4ff6-9238-7a5acf8066ac

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.817
Now we have to determine the input

bc0ffd4c-4294-4678-b002-c235a2a5eebd

f505ef91-18cd-4cfd-8dd9-1c7c958856b7

ae9419db-e9fb-4448-8c02-a85f650ce52c
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.360

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.800
if we are at the 00,

00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:38.278
We transfer back to the 00 Y.

00:35:12.887 --> 00:35:15.451

cd5629cd-ad61-4817-b6dc-d76a91f6eba7
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:26.510
we still stay at the same state 00.

5e893813-ea16-437e-90fa-2b48fcd76eea
00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.748
so you have to basically check that if

00:36:20.305 --> 00:36:22.798
the value of flip flops matters,

e3a0bac9-ebc4-4662-a507-dd22853eb4d6
00:36:25.509 --> 00:36:28.826
and the value of inputs actually guide

the output to the diagram,

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.590
where should I put that?

1bf16c0d-3f97-4231-a4dd-83fe6456baaf
00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:08.818
Anybody can help me?

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.280
So if you back to the state table,

640421ed-1363-42ba-a964-cd76ac88bc42
00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.730
basically we say that if

c5472ad8-8e20-4ecf-b3c1-78443a4e8abe
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.180

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.166
Imagine we are at this state.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:34.046
So if we are at this stage regardless

00:38:34.046 --> 00:38:40.070

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:43.759
So. Because based on the more model,

6cae5a6d-7426-451e-a053-00374dc61b20
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:47.344
it only depends on the value of the

00:38:47.344 --> 00:38:50.160
flip flops. So if I want to add.

In the circuit, should I add this

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:21.159
And the reason is because F only

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:23.538

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:27.396
so it doesn't depend on the X so.

12d31bb7-f2ca-48a9-8c5b-ef1a73885587
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.952

9270795e-048d-41da-8073-854fbad61140
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:34.154
And one thing is that because now

d9b421c6-540e-4932-9768-e143e0fed92b
00:48:34.154 --> 00:48:36.930
the value of F depends on the X

NOTE Confidence: 0.8475072

07cd7902-ed53-40d2-82f2-3dffa9bd6d6b
00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:39.240
and the state of the circuit,

4f02943c-202a-4d5c-8d31-a6bc42bdae21
00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.160
you cannot put the output inside the node.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8475072

6a4192de-2e17-4d42-a0a6-8d14dede903e
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.163
You have to output the output on

0a58144f-d8d1-4a59-8286-ec14a50b4708
00:48:48.332 --> 00:48:52.750

00:49:03.965 --> 00:49:06.660
you transit to the next State 01,

852f7fd2-e9e4-4ccd-9373-3538dca1b690
00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.940
the value of F becomes one.

fa1619f2-a7c4-4bc6-9ebe-b6e44c0f3976
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:21.560
meaning that a is 1B0.

96fd8b8f-0be0-416f-9eb6-2c3f1b4743a3
00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.624
The value of F or the

If it is zero, it is zero,

cc8f757a-4c73-4c84-b692-f2d831facbe6

if it is one, it is still one,

666dd83c-5905-44e1-962f-4fde3dcbfde5
00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.984
So here is the small change when you

73f62fd1-5fad-49d7-b720-b8fe9e1ca979
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:52.186
So we are done with the analysis of the

e40f905e-0dda-4217-8c96-51b411edd6a6
00:49:52.186 --> 00:49:54.685

00:49:54.685 --> 00:49:57.409
have to be careful that the output is

fa8ffd9a-e56e-449a-bed4-44ca6b925efc
00:50:00.601 --> 00:50:03.660
Millie is kind of complex because it

6c7877fa-e002-4eea-9122-60e435eaef54
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:13.385
So now we want to go to next step

5875a672-1578-4915-9dd5-46caeedc8000
00:50:13.385 --> 00:50:16.749
which is design of a circuit that

00:50:16.749 --> 00:50:20.218
needs input output and the flip flops.

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:23.360
So before I start.

ba3227e1-9b4d-4a98-9f00-ba5a8d9015c0
00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.020
Any questions so far?

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:46.630
So again like previous.

f6fe8641-2500-4b94-a6f5-85e98f7d7466
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.746

something like that. I make sure

ae150ca2-c4fd-44ea-8aee-238f4a7f76ac
00:50:54.774 --> 00:50:58.660
that you have the focus. So great.

9b7a55ed-a9bb-4b45-a3b4-4ef4cedcf727
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:05.470
So I need six more. 11

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:13.632
So how about other students? OK, so nice.

43102a7b-b523-41c5-b7ff-51563e80162a
00:51:13.632 --> 00:51:16.776
So let's continue with the design.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

05cc38fa-1533-4365-82e3-7d6c177a7aba
00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:19.286
So again, I'm going to explain the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

34b9383e-9bf7-4c36-bdf2-021d22c1d78e
00:51:19.286 --> 00:51:22.193
design by that example so you have to

3a966b99-8de0-4577-9948-94e06c045164
00:51:22.193 --> 00:51:25.119
practice these at home or with different.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.254
I mean examples.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

972db09d-7228-4ec9-9604-8d0c4b55458b
00:51:26.254 --> 00:51:28.144
Just it's not just memorizing,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

0cfb9a4d-b5f1-4a8e-bef4-a093375ff7ac
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:29.662
you have to practice.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

a9695929-0f3e-4523-8915-ee80ce63d71b
00:51:29.662 --> 00:51:30.796
It's like programming.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

b2fca7a0-58c4-4e8b-816e-ccd0999f8e23
00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.144
So you have to program or you have

7db5bc28-01fb-4064-8df5-bdb35ab29cda
00:51:34.144 --> 00:51:37.122
to practice to know what are the

1961764b-cab0-4d85-93d9-d2828bc4774d
00:51:37.122 --> 00:51:39.900
steps of the analysis or design.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

d9150c88-7f52-4046-9e16-c17d7d766508
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.150
So because in the lecture

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

dfee1112-f3ff-4d24-bf9e-d23d041ac6da
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:42.910
we have time for an example,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

5414b098-1f18-4801-a528-748853eaa12e
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:46.620
so I leave it to you to practice at home.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

325e621e-2303-4670-9ed1-61f766e66fd4
00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:49.302
Also in the office so we can practice more.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

bc3e95ef-dace-4359-8432-31d0711aa6e4
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:52.229
So let's see what is the design

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

85eefc88-d46a-48ba-962a-0703ebb4be59
00:51:52.229 --> 00:51:54.599
we have input and output.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

d107da43-1df7-4309-b54e-f0e8ba6d197c
00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:55.992
First and foremost,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

d00f1b99-7654-4357-bdaf-51bb1cde20c1
00:51:55.992 --> 00:51:59.240
we have to see that the problem

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

81500c07-d152-483f-95ae-c76a39a91517
00:51:59.336 --> 00:52:02.157
needs an input or output or no.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

8c10f6cd-f845-4348-baf3-69d8c36fc060
00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:05.443
So it depends on whether we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

18c5d072-3410-478f-b3ee-df5a25500e80
00:52:05.443 --> 00:52:08.133
solve the problem only by flip

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

cbd6c843-8cdb-41bb-b662-6735c867cc0a
00:52:08.133 --> 00:52:11.515
flops or we have to add some input

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

5537b715-f8d1-4141-8a83-13a09f14be3c
00:52:11.515 --> 00:52:14.719
and outputs to solve the problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

a988a2dd-f058-494e-acf2-5a183db5b226
00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.096
So here I put an example.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

ac4f2b2b-d325-423e-987c-c3136fc74e88
00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.476
I want to design A circuit

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

a9f33494-b05d-4f7b-aa12-f5db7bb8a8d6
00:52:19.476 --> 00:52:21.859
that counts up and down it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

e5dc9744-35ab-4e23-ae63-d092778f6cbb
00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.639
It is not just a counter up,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

00f6c8d0-265d-4fa9-a19c-72ba9623e132
00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:28.960
its counts not only up but also counts down.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

e52c98dd-ea4c-41bf-9eb7-c6e3b1f0dd7a
00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:32.158
So basically this circuit is this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

6c6a1b23-9cdd-4ebe-b6b9-3097b1d7d90f
00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:36.104
So I want to the behavior the circuit

29913bda-dc46-400c-b11d-d878452978af
00:52:36.104 --> 00:52:40.644
counts up if I want to do I mean from

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

460b30e5-ba3a-4d08-bf04-bcfa5b359f82
00:52:40.644 --> 00:52:43.928
counting from zero to some number N.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

b46d0901-3837-4cbd-b6e3-7f01a70283c7
00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:46.456
But sometime I changed my mind

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

6ea328a3-d565-43f2-b813-7b4024d288ed
00:52:46.456 --> 00:52:49.709
and I want to ask the second

21b4ebe0-14d3-477d-a921-b307a1205cd7
00:52:49.709 --> 00:52:52.643
account back so it counts down.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

6c74ee7d-19cb-4353-884f-41d5a1875feb
00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:56.031
So basically you can count 01234 and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

c98a95f6-974d-4f0b-8d04-c0a135fd7f92
00:52:56.031 --> 00:52:59.539
suddenly you want to change their behavior

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

685b0b9a-6432-48d1-a889-a1fb27ede122
00:52:59.539 --> 00:53:02.940
and then count down SO5432 and etc.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

6c57c443-f3eb-4511-9b1d-cde729ba0dd1
00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:05.166
So basically there is a switch

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

75c1c801-1f72-4b6e-bbf0-e5689d82f7bc
00:53:05.166 --> 00:53:07.550
between the behavior of the circuit.

22f03459-fef1-4d58-be3f-64c5393876a0
00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:09.848
Either it goes up or down,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

58989974-6efd-47d4-978c-89c93b3478ac
00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:13.308
but you want to do this in

f6d2fb2d-d23c-40d9-89e9-51151ec1a021
00:53:13.308 --> 00:53:15.740
the same single second.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

79ca5778-8dfb-417e-bac5-9b121fa7a162
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:19.366
So basically you want to switch between

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737739

98ce3b17-b9c2-43a5-a41b-e9c1991d817c

01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:14.350
So the input must be 0.

From zero to one, we have to do set.

The input must be one.

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:28.609
so if the input is zero it becomes zero.

d51eb020-8ab4-4200-9787-76d6dde9a0d2

use jaycar flip flop, it has two inputs.

41fc4cae-4219-4614-9b02-9dc18319f2c8
01:19:55.644 --> 01:19:58.530
As a result you have to do 2 equations

b47133ac-914a-4b75-9748-1db3e752fa73
01:19:58.530 --> 01:20:00.600

ask you to use a JK

01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:15.956
it takes a lot of time.

c499b2be-80d9-47cf-8671-6e019f837c2c
01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.355
However, in the practice because

01:20:18.355 --> 01:20:20.750
after the simplification it has

a3ac14d0-fbbb-43b2-a203-23681fc7f03d
01:20:20.828 --> 01:20:23.450
because it has don't air condition,

5607012d-efba-4dd0-b99e-3ffc4c2af4ce
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:26.258
it ends up with less gate.

1f63cf6e-a499-45ec-bb79-5d4fb014e2fc
01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:29.045
So in practice in choosing

01:20:29.045 --> 01:20:31.273

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:33.720
Because it's needs less

01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:41.971
because it has two inputs. It has more.

01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:45.390
I mean you have to write 2 equation function.

a2a84bd0-019f-4914-917e-bf7b257c6749
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:47.889

01:21:07.450 --> 01:21:09.780
then you would use Jakaya.
