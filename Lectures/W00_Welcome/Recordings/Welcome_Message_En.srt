00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:05,860
Welcome!

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,880
Digital Design with Hossein

4
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,080
Hello everyone!

5
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,240
Welcome dear students in the course digital design

6
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,240
In this course we are going to know or learn how a computer system  is workin

7
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,840
[showing the inside of a computer workstation]

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,940
As you can see here a typical computer system

9
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,300
Any computer system has three (3) main components

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,600
I/O devices.

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,560
(1) Here I have a hard disk drive which we store all our files and images

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,920
(2) We have a memory module.

13
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:11,340
All the information must be loaded to memory in order to be processed by other components of a computer system

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,340
And (3) the main component which is a CPU, central processing unit

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,660
Which does the actual operation and execute the statements

16
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,200
There are two other important parts as well.

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,120
Power which gives the electrical power to the whole system

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,500
And also a motherboard or mainboard

19
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,700
Which interconnects all these components to each other

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,000
I already opened the mainboard (motherboard) from the casing

21
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,140
And you can see here closely all the main components (not the I/O and the power units)

22
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,120
The main component as I said is the CPU.

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,840
Behind this cooling fan, which cools down the CPU when executing the operations,

24
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,100
The CPU is installed (presented).

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:28,740
[opening the cooling fan to show the CPU behind it]

26
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:36,420
I opened this cooling fan, behind it there is a chip which is called cpu

27
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,000
[detaching CPU from the motherboard (mainboard)]

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This is the CPU

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,560
So basically we are going to zoom inside this structure and see how it is designed

30
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,140
And how it is executing the commands or (program) statements

31
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:04,820
You might ask why we should know the inside of this digital board or the inside of the CPU

32
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:10,800
Today we can write the programs and upload them to the cloud (machines)

33
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,520
The cloud is running our programs (nowadays)

34
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,280
You might say that there is no need to know how a computer system is working

35
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,800
The reason is if you know how a computer system is working, you can write programs efficiently

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,360
You can write programs that run faster

37
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,540
Or take less space (memory)

38
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,300
So that's (one of) the main reasons that we have know how a computer system is working

39
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,860
Also, at the end of the day, all programs are running on a computer system.

40
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:53,300
Who knows, one day you might want to work for those cloud companies and want to build the computer system for the cloud system

41
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:00,600
In this course, however, we are not going to discuss how a computer system is actually built from the physical (layer) perspective

42
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,880
If you want to know that (to build your own computer system)

43
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,260
You have to take advanced courses such as Computer Architecture II, or

44
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,440
(taking courses from) Computer or Electrical programs

45
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,700
In those courses, they teach you how to manufacture hardware

46
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,760
However, in this course, we just want to know what is inside,

47
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,740
How the connections (circuits) are made

48
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,940
And the CPU is executing the commands

49
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,180
Thank you everyone for your attention

50
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,840
And looking forward to seeing you all next week on Monday (September 14, 2020 )

51
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,360
Meanwhile, if you have any questions, or concerns about this course, you can simply send me emails

52
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,180
I will try my best to answer right away

53
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,900
And have a great day

54
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Bye
