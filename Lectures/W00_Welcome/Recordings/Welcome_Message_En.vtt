00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.360
[writing on chalkboard]

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.860
Welcome!

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.880
Digital Design with Hossein

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.080
Hello everyone!

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.240
Welcome dear students in the course digital design

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.240
In this course we are going to know or learn how a computer system  is workin

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.840
[showing the inside of a computer workstation]

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.940
As you can see here a typical computer system

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.300
Any computer system has three (3) main components

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.600
I/O devices.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.560
(1) Here I have a hard disk drive which we store all our files and images

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920
(2) We have a memory module.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.340
All the information must be loaded to memory in order to be processed by other components of a computer system

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.340
And (3) the main component which is a CPU, central processing unit

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.660
Which does the actual operation and execute the statements

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.200
There are two other important parts as well.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.120
Power which gives the electrical power to the whole system

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.500
And also a motherboard or mainboard

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.700
Which interconnects all these components to each other

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.000
I already opened the mainboard (motherboard) from the casing

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.140
And you can see here closely all the main components (not the I/O and the power units)

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.120
The main component as I said is the CPU.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.840
Behind this cooling fan, which cools down the CPU when executing the operations,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.100
The CPU is installed (presented).

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:28.740
[opening the cooling fan to show the CPU behind it]

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:36.420
I opened this cooling fan, behind it there is a chip which is called cpu

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.000
[detaching CPU from the motherboard (mainboard)]

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
This is the CPU

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.560
So basically we are going to zoom inside this structure and see how it is designed

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.140
And how it is executing the commands or (program) statements

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:04.820
You might ask why we should know the inside of this digital board or the inside of the CPU

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.800
Today we can write the programs and upload them to the cloud (machines)

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.520
The cloud is running our programs (nowadays)

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.280
You might say that there is no need to know how a computer system is working

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.800
The reason is if you know how a computer system is working, you can write programs efficiently

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.360
You can write programs that run faster

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.540
Or take less space (memory)

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.300
So that's (one of) the main reasons that we have know how a computer system is working

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.860
Also, at the end of the day, all programs are running on a computer system.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:53.300
Who knows, one day you might want to work for those cloud companies and want to build the computer system for the cloud system

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.600
In this course, however, we are not going to discuss how a computer system is actually built from the physical (layer) perspective

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.880
If you want to know that (to build your own computer system)

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.260
You have to take advanced courses such as Computer Architecture II, or

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.440
(taking courses from) Computer or Electrical programs

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.700
In those courses, they teach you how to manufacture hardware

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.760
However, in this course, we just want to know what is inside,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.740
How the connections (circuits) are made

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.940
And the CPU is executing the commands

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.180
Thank you everyone for your attention

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.840
And looking forward to seeing you all next week on Monday (September 14, 2020 )

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.360
Meanwhile, if you have any questions, or concerns about this course, you can simply send me emails

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.180
I will try my best to answer right away

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.900
And have a great day

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.900
Bye
