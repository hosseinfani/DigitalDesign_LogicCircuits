cdbca8f1-c2d0-4c4b-b4fa-8e9fdb51a3ed
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.670
They started to form some
problems. One of the basic ones

NOTE Confidence: 0.90089076757431

6a164e73-4a49-4c27-9e6a-e17cb5193f12
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.610
are those that they just wanted
to travel to the stars or

14bed782-89b2-4771-b23d-a182160a964e

They just wanted to explore the

universe. So the first step to
do that is just

2983b429-593f-4334-8ad3-6688e5bc365b
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.395
How can we measure the distance
of our own Earth to the stars?

0304853c-a2b8-4a70-98c6-7b9cf1366088
00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:35.015
Or how can we measure the
height? Or how can we measure

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:39.250
the lengths, so these are just
very basic problems, but they are

still essential problems.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.590

basic one. Measuring the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.920
And we want to measure the
distance, for instance from

are just very basic questions that

can we measure for instance,

dfaf5e88-c729-4678-a0eb-76ec0e6717bc

00:03:34.274 --> 00:03:39.730
measure this long

41f17c9f-5332-4c35-9126-646ee531f46c
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.186
version of the solution to the
problem was that let's take

0f5d6208-afa2-47aa-9216-f53b3d4f28fc
00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:50.146
another object or another store
as a unit and then

db8727ff-f8c9-469f-b66d-3ed69d46dc2c
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.610

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.336
Uh, for instance, in order to
calculate the measure of the

56294e55-15dd-4333-839b-cd4ad3e27e2c
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.748
then we can

ee9ab0e4-e444-478b-aae7-30519c2ceb21
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.470

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.678
based on the number of Earth you
have to take to reach the Sun

bfac24e3-6151-4adc-bef6-c72070fabea4

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.152
So this was the most naive

7931f430-f389-4df6-a292-8c4fa79a30c8
00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:27.170
version. So the problem actually
reduced to this. How many Earth

383107b0-3300-471d-9e33-ce5483979124
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.818
we need to pass.

a9577694-2b32-4452-bff2-4457eb6fcffe
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.066
So at first we put just one
Earth and then the second Earth. So

f1b3d849-75dc-4698-a78c-209d4f6cc3f3
00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:38.602
it means that we have to pass
twice the Earth diameter and

ec4696d0-123f-4c39-a6dc-5492d0abe394
00:04:38.602 --> 00:04:43.894
 then three, four and five. So the five is actually is kind of

00:04:43.894 --> 00:04:48.430
with a little bit error.
But we can have a compromise

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.344
and we can say that the Moon's

the reflection of light in a

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:17.096

And then when we go to the

instead of just inventing a new

00:35:17.261 --> 00:35:22.976
you only have one symbol, so we
only have I. So when we want to

00:35:22.976 --> 00:35:27.167

00:36:43.605 --> 00:36:47.855
we are building a computer system based on the unary

00:36:59.968 --> 00:37:04.921

symbols. So as you can see they
create these symbols and then the

interesting thing is that at
first they were no symbol for

that there is no need to

00:38:35.405 --> 00:38:39.530
represent zero distance, but
later they figured out it is a

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:43.280

0. So they introduced the symbol

for zero distance and then it
breaks down to the two

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:52.878

dd58515f-ed2f-48bd-a6d2-915cdeb180ec

So now the next step is for, but

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:12.145
we don't have the digit for 4. So
again as we did for here in this

then we add 0. So in my

00:42:42.152 --> 00:42:46.694

here for the four, instead of

c300f928-f93b-48c0-bfb8-81aaca6dfea5

00:43:21.188 --> 00:43:25.724

80ee5e2a-bae1-425b-bac1-df13b9780b59
00:43:25.724 --> 00:43:30.260
we don't have anymore digits for
the four or five, we introduce a

00:43:34.418 --> 00:43:40.466
So for instance, the next after
8 is 9, so 331 is equal to 9 and

e0f92d3d-c34c-4487-8035-0df9115fd3fe
00:43:40.466 --> 00:43:41.978
then 332 is 10.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:48.155
And then 333 is 11. Now the next
step we don't have anymore

bdb5e765-ded0-4954-8b27-1cd0fa6297e5
00:43:48.155 --> 00:43:52.830
 digits for after 3. So we introduce new position to the

left and then add 0. So the next
unit gonna be 3330. So this is

00:43:59.205 --> 00:44:05.580

NOTE Confidence: 0.869519233703613

4b48da5b-e167-4487-8b14-5786aeee1365
00:46:35.123 --> 00:46:40.597
a new position when we run
out of the digits, so you don't

NOTE Confidence: 0.869519233703613

a6318a33-4207-4f0e-b4d9-c922fa85de16
00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:46.462
have zero in between. So here as
you can see we are done with the

NOTE Confidence: 0.869519233703613

1c0ff749-e625-4b1f-b966-82c9520ad9b6
00:46:46.462 --> 00:46:51.154
three and then we introduce new
position. But we are not putting

3291b219-b1a0-4bff-bb0f-421782ccfb32
00:46:51.154 --> 00:46:55.455
123. So in Hossein's numbering system, all the positions in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.869519233703613

721e833e-0dfd-4277-b490-0ab2ed490992
00:46:55.455 --> 00:47:00.538
left side must occupied with the

e5cdcef2-23a2-4058-9084-6cbfdd5ea46f
00:47:00.538 --> 00:47:03.767
position. So this is not the
correct actually number in

40a5e243-9db5-4dfa-92b1-3c57f3084dee
00:47:03.767 --> 00:47:06.584
Hossein's system, and so the
answer is not valid.

a7287f48-e6ae-4337-96fe-35a8a1c7de11
00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.556
So let's move on to
the next question.

d14e7656-d081-48bf-b7ee-cac17017dc7d
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:16.249
How about this?

1b6afe85-252e-4ba4-a343-58fbacf752b5
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:23.514
 This is a number in Hossein's number system and we want to

00:47:23.514 --> 00:47:30.040
know what's the actual value. Is
it valid first of all, and if it is

f99461db-8257-4c63-b1d1-24e79660ad4f
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.056
valid, what's the equilvalent number
in decimal system?

NOTE Confidence: 0.88977837562561

074877f4-14f9-4801-a7fc-564d3c6f5aed
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:22.194
So let's
figure out

d928d38a-59da-4983-825c-8c5735a402f9
00:48:22.194 --> 00:48:30.038
the answer.
So the

054d5f1b-b0e4-44df-99ce-843e92eced26
00:48:30.038 --> 00:48:34.770
number is.
See.

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:42.616
We want this so this number means
that we are already

8a60a3a1-17cf-45fe-ac2e-e3b835da31c2
00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:51.520
past one run over the digits, so
we already count from 1 to

NOTE Confidence: 0.833321273326874

74c7597b-55ab-483e-bfac-b389725af979
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:58.300
0123 so we already did 3 units,
including the 000 unit, nothing

56cf7322-a5a8-47c2-b306-629bbe4b062d
00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:03.780
123. We keep that here and then
we introduce a new position and

dc6ef132-b86d-48d3-867b-dc77450df2f3
00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:07.795
then we did another three and
then we introduce a new

1e57829f-949e-478d-8a44-7df09fa28dc3
00:49:07.795 --> 00:49:11.080

7b72e55e-8b6a-4c30-9134-f2dc7270f933
00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.365
whenever we introduce a new
position, we actually take

00:49:14.365 --> 00:49:16.190
another step. So 3 units.

then for this three positions,

00:49:45.617 --> 00:49:51.965
one new three step, one new

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:57.914
So basically this is for

dc956714-1b5a-44a9-858e-62b33af80f34
00:49:57.914 --> 00:50:04.360
three step, one position. So as you
can see we can just some

f7065e2c-c7a4-4409-8e6c-d6e6e7282cd3

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:38.130

3699681f-d0cf-4d3f-8d04-9979aa8fdd67
00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:41.150
go back to the slides.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:51.209
And put it in a math
formulation. So let's start from

NOTE Confidence: 0.836031556129456

5b7ec858-6ffd-4947-80ee-9ba2b50d43dd
00:50:51.209 --> 00:50:57.956
this zero. So 0123 is
exactly the same as, uh, let me

ab5e3269-fcb6-4e27-8894-174b8a350065

NOTE Confidence: 0.888367414474487

0437f71c-d05a-40c9-9073-9744ca7582d9
00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.406
So from

NOTE Confidence: 0.87939190864563

e71e77d3-5da8-4382-8a4d-ab188da38f84
00:51:05.406 --> 00:51:11.262
0123. This is the
exact equal number in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.87939190864563

e3c19dcf-793e-4c5b-955e-e15896a199ad
00:51:11.262 --> 00:51:16.230
decimal system, so we don't have
any new positions, so it means

NOTE Confidence: 0.87939190864563

785b685d-02b5-49fc-9a33-513464ba24e4
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:21.612
that we don't have new
positions, so there is no unit

NOTE Confidence: 0.87939190864563

a7d6da99-0ca8-42b5-a3e8-5077459cc548
00:51:21.612 --> 00:51:28.236
taken by the new position. So 1
- 1 is 0, so there is no step taken

NOTE Confidence: 0.87939190864563

5cc1f24d-5248-4a47-bec7-7021baf5010c
00:51:28.236 --> 00:51:30.306
by new position, only the

3622cd50-539c-4012-960f-f01f333abb80
00:51:30.306 --> 00:51:35.660
number. And then when we are
here, we introduce a new

abd233b3-3aaf-4904-8888-dfe5144b01cf
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:40.532
position and then we add 0. So
we already take three steps.

6d12639e-4e7e-4c33-b3f6-21f0b287d018
00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:46.404
And then we take zero step next.
But we introduced new positions.

9fb99d38-ada9-4652-80d1-85fb4bdf37bf
00:51:46.404 --> 00:51:51.708
So one unit, so 2 - 1 becomes
four altogether, sum together.

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:57.067
And then we continue here, for
instance, here we have three

aa00c9a9-0fa1-4cd2-b67e-ab2c275df955
00:51:57.067 --> 00:52:01.434
step before three step another
step, and then we introduce a

4a163f82-3546-42f7-ae26-24b3294b62a7
00:52:01.434 --> 00:52:06.595

position, one is equal to 2 - 1.

00:53:49.566 --> 00:53:51.134
see, the questions are.

NOTE Confidence: 0.582007110118866

94281f89-807e-4caf-908b-b70634240307
00:53:54.730 --> 00:54:00.770
 Uh Sean you can unmute, I mean

ab4a11e2-20f2-44ac-b7a3-a59c9388fe12
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:06.181
to let Koto ask her question or his question. They clicked the

00:54:06.181 --> 00:54:07.474
button on accident.

b70efac7-6c50-467e-b315-c7bcc5644c97
00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.300
Oh OK, cool.

NOTE Confidence: 0.832944095134735

c8d4a4c3-a438-43b7-ad43-e7386b3af624
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.888
So let's continue so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86091947555542

91805cef-a58f-47fe-b613-5caa40125de9
00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:19.580
Now imagine in general we have N
positions. What is the minimum

NOTE Confidence: 0.86091947555542

1129015d-3d9a-439c-9acb-ff6800b148a1
00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:24.255
number in Hossein System and
what is the maximum number? So

NOTE Confidence: 0.86091947555542

6463f725-2643-4244-abb9-a035d1989294
00:54:24.255 --> 00:54:29.780
the minimum number is the 0 so
we can just simply put the

NOTE Confidence: 0.86091947555542

ae20a4b0-8b8f-4a03-abe7-7770c9944729
00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:34.880
digit zero in all positions. So
the minimum is trivial 0. How

NOTE Confidence: 0.86091947555542

86284a15-f7f3-4468-a054-b3ba14e9a451
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:39.130
about the maximum, the maximum
number in Hossein's system is

NOTE Confidence: 0.86091947555542

8435248b-9782-45a4-a60e-e2a377a1f65c
00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:44.230
equal to this number in all
positions we put the digit 3.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905778050422668

91836136-4a1e-4bf3-a2f1-56381543cc69
00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:48.930
So 3333 up until the

NOTE Confidence: 0.838525950908661

1df9a98a-5e8e-4810-9779-4982cfb3e871
00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:54.320
first position. So let's count all these three and see what is

NOTE Confidence: 0.838525950908661

8804faeb-1ed3-4e77-8934-d94d3e9c8ac3
00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:55.720
the equal max number?

NOTE Confidence: 0.879741728305817

da977842-e06c-49a5-aa85-9561fa265b26
00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:04.935
By simple math, I mean we can
just do this. I get all

NOTE Confidence: 0.879741728305817

f08dae42-81ea-4b88-81e4-4d69d6ed1125
00:55:04.935 --> 00:55:08.862
these steps we've done so far,
plus the number of new

NOTE Confidence: 0.879741728305817

7b9c724d-077e-491c-a333-aec1f82d16f4
00:55:08.862 --> 00:55:13.146
positions. So we have a
position N minus one, then

NOTE Confidence: 0.879741728305817

c9f95952-773a-4d99-ab65-29e177322217
00:55:13.146 --> 00:55:14.931
plus N minus one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.910241603851318

ecae4a8c-9e54-4778-9fb7-20da278026ae
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.798
So it becomes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.889628648757935

85cd7279-d5eb-42ee-8e5f-c520afb3b879
00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:24.445
3 N plus N minus one, at the
end we have four times N minus

NOTE Confidence: 0.877792298793793

de2769f1-462a-45b0-9d13-087fcbc6cf48
00:55:24.445 --> 00:55:31.012
one. So as an example, if we
are given 10 positions as we did

NOTE Confidence: 0.877792298793793

01bb6cc4-4c88-44a0-8551-22678a55ac7e
00:55:31.012 --> 00:55:36.528
calculation, it is equal to four
times and which is equal to 10 -

NOTE Confidence: 0.877792298793793

418b0b35-0838-4ee6-8d6d-389f0a4a4bbc
00:55:36.528 --> 00:55:40.074
1. So 40 - 1 is 39. So in

NOTE Confidence: 0.894716322422028

cae62c77-1422-47e5-9671-79deccf57463
00:55:40.074 --> 00:55:44.846
Hossein system with ten
positions, it is possible to

NOTE Confidence: 0.894716322422028

2e5b8f93-1a61-4ca8-b5fe-bf58e1ca7914
00:55:44.846 --> 00:55:49.526
represent numbers from 0 1 2 up
until 39, but you cannot

NOTE Confidence: 0.894716322422028

42da669c-1778-4f97-b505-2d1d9815a727
00:55:49.526 --> 00:55:54.674
 represent 40 in Hossein's system when you are given only 10 

NOTE Confidence: 0.907886743545532

55db7fed-18b1-4dad-98fe-3c7aa9a5ce49
00:55:54.674 --> 00:55:58.330
positions. You need another new
position, but you are limited to

NOTE Confidence: 0.875245451927185

cead0e78-15cb-466e-9310-0653576d784f
00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:02.696
10. So this way you know,
uh, when you're building

NOTE Confidence: 0.875245451927185

206f3a7e-abc3-431b-bb53-c7969c5f7f60
00:56:02.696 --> 00:56:05.768
a system to analyze the
numbers, the numbering

NOTE Confidence: 0.875245451927185

b77dcee0-3fea-4da4-95ed-a5fa7cf0afa3
00:56:05.768 --> 00:56:07.304
system is very important.

NOTE Confidence: 0.882125794887543

9636425e-82bb-46ad-b4d0-9f2ddc10319a
00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:12.347
So as you can see in
Hossein system there is a

NOTE Confidence: 0.882125794887543

bf055cf2-6e8e-475a-8d8f-b7cb0c01f87b
00:56:12.347 --> 00:56:14.883
very little range of
numbers that can be analyzed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.888124644756317

49f26c5a-c0bb-48c0-9a2d-a185b97752b5
00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:21.178
How about the reverse? If you
are given a number and you

NOTE Confidence: 0.888124644756317

e071ce91-c7ea-4e5c-9760-b76051fc4f12
00:56:21.178 --> 00:56:25.186
wanted to know how many space
you need in order to represent

NOTE Confidence: 0.888124644756317

57b96372-5ecd-4147-b8f5-07f2015001d9
00:56:25.186 --> 00:56:26.856
that number in Hossein system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.865045964717865

477e6c51-c634-491b-9086-5c3ac0158862
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:30.406
Uh how would we calculate the
number of position.

NOTE Confidence: 0.881814241409302

58260053-a5c7-455b-ab64-f231c8c291b7
00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:35.592
The answers is that you just simply
take that given number as the

NOTE Confidence: 0.881814241409302

13db0963-8dde-4a7e-94c9-7ca798240c6c
00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:39.864
maximum number and then put it
in that formula. So imagine the

NOTE Confidence: 0.881814241409302

f8e28f66-1c81-40f6-9980-30d955784347
00:56:39.864 --> 00:56:44.136
maximum number we are going to
represent is N. Capital N. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.881814241409302

2d1e95d3-6c9e-4f01-97e5-e78a00f00a0a
00:56:44.136 --> 00:56:48.764
capital N is the maximum, is
equal to four times N minus one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.881814241409302

f3bc821c-cd09-4e96-ac88-f4883c71f5c1
00:56:48.764 --> 00:56:51.256
And small n is the number of

NOTE Confidence: 0.893468916416168

120e0adb-5ffe-4af1-be79-8e78e09ee0aa
00:56:51.256 --> 00:56:56.518
positions. So by doing a little
bit math you can see that the

NOTE Confidence: 0.893468916416168

7d6a6f38-65a2-4d48-b7fa-c78d76d51c2d
00:56:56.518 --> 00:57:00.522
number of position is equal to N
plus 1 / 4.

NOTE Confidence: 0.931307077407837

ab65ebf5-a544-46ed-adcd-f4e0bfae5bae
00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.676
So let's go back to our
first question.

NOTE Confidence: 0.807689189910889

16de661e-591f-4971-9d10-2e465dab091d
00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:11.532
Ah, now we wanted to represent
the most distance to the Sun, but

NOTE Confidence: 0.807689189910889

81c238fc-c6e0-4e37-ba04-162dd6c17a55
00:57:11.532 --> 00:57:15.943
 this time in Hossein System, not in the unary system. And see whether 

NOTE Confidence: 0.807689189910889

b5016207-4e41-4bc7-b63a-dce3c5058325
00:57:15.943 --> 00:57:19.953
 the Hossein System is a better system or not. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.91856461763382

c58740df-b2e5-411d-a497-27cf56adfdb8
00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:25.125
So I put this as a question

NOTE Confidence: 0.902950286865234

35c4934c-0bd3-4b25-8420-4ca699281bb3
00:57:25.125 --> 00:57:32.330
here. So
please go to the same URL and

NOTE Confidence: 0.902950286865234

57a816e2-1ee7-4c8e-97b7-a919ebbb0e28
00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:34.250
let's see your answers.

NOTE Confidence: 0.891348123550415

22e7815c-54d4-4da5-a484-7bc05cb47329
00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:43.510
So again, imagine you are given
the distance. The actual

NOTE Confidence: 0.891348123550415

72eda91b-9de8-4f71-afb9-a68bfcba0afb
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:48.280
distance is about 150 million
kilometers. Earth diameter is

a4925dcd-1f8c-45b4-84a0-7318a03de22a
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:53.050
13,000. And each page can contain
about 3000 characters.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84274822473526

2f79f456-a707-46c7-8cdd-ecdb61049dad
00:57:56.810 --> 00:58:02.378
We already know that based on the
Earth diameter, the distance is

NOTE Confidence: 0.84274822473526

bfa8cfb8-1492-4348-962b-55820232f5d3
00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:07.946
about 12,000 Earth or units of Earth. So in unary system we

NOTE Confidence: 0.84274822473526

3c5c57ca-0788-4243-b7c7-c4cd8b3c1418
00:58:07.946 --> 00:58:13.050
need to have thousand positions.
But here how can we represent

NOTE Confidence: 0.84274822473526

34c066a4-753c-40de-ba7e-0c1cf9d583db
00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:14.906
12,000 in Hossein system?

NOTE Confidence: 0.938717067241669

8632815d-19be-4e04-8608-b02831d8e3cd
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:22.240
So let me share my screen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922414004802704

2e2ba55a-ac1e-4497-852b-fada630b1052
00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:30.078
My camera. So
we already

d75eef54-dd3b-414c-87e1-7ab661e4da4f
00:58:30.078 --> 00:58:36.222
knew that
the maximum

1fbf09c8-9484-4932-a67e-31789b275cac
00:58:36.222 --> 00:58:43.920
number is equal to four
times N minus one. And then if

NOTE Confidence: 0.852110207080841

483a3e4e-7a2d-44ec-be7f-3ff4cf99b9de
00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.720
we are given N, we can

32a907e9-3c27-4a7c-91b9-51df6f0ecac9
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:53.890
calculate the number of positions, so
the n is equal to N plus

NOTE Confidence: 0.879627108573914

ccb99899-a9ce-42fd-a472-c7b4dc8ae742
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:55.480
1 / 4.

NOTE Confidence: 0.913990676403046

5158eb27-0031-48bd-98f6-381cd57bb873
00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:58.679
But what is N in this question?

NOTE Confidence: 0.853010952472687

cded2ae9-4037-4a26-a497-5218d305b485
00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:05.245
N is as we did, we
know that the distance of

7c4602b0-5749-450b-91b2-cfa43bcc8d3b
00:59:05.245 --> 00:59:09.070
Moon to the Earth is
about 12,000 Earth.

95979fa0-b4ef-4ac0-94ee-70c745678683
00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:14.433
 So this time , we wanna represent this number in Hossein's system? So 

NOTE Confidence: 0.824149787425995

ee51619c-7254-4e5a-b0be-cce7af38fd88
00:59:14.433 --> 00:59:17.863
in Hossein system we assume that this is the N.

d8e12825-fe55-46bf-b346-9e31d6819c30
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:25.745
So it becomes 12,000. This is
the maximum number plus 1 / 4

NOTE Confidence: 0.901292443275452

b470d929-9162-42f1-879a-9fdf600681d4

f044f791-b8b0-4173-8452-8af6053f9fbb
00:59:32.692 --> 00:59:38.890

00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:41.390
represent this number and 12,000 in

00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:48.983
Hossein system. But as you said,
if we have a paper that can

roughly put about 3000

ec86c30b-5cce-4443-9f3b-dae3270fbdad
00:59:54.313 --> 01:00:00.176
need one page in order to

c2419fdd-2484-47c5-95ab-36b8d2a51ac4
01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:12.218
We have to fill out this page by three, and
this is the number, equal number,

29c2862e-3fd7-47fc-8a58-5f9c26cf4c1c
01:00:12.218 --> 01:00:16.844
 just one page to represent 12,000 in Hossein's system.

059c10b0-b294-411e-acc0-ea43406fcb44
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:18.840
So let's see the answer.

3847cc9d-0204-4ad0-8c84-2f9eb3f8b188
01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:27.739
Ah. Actually, more
than half of this students

01:00:27.739 --> 01:00:30.124
actually had the correct answer.

If you have questions, just put
it in the chat and I can

the time for Q&A.

cef713fb-a65b-4f29-9cdb-ac875042ce73
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:46.260
So. As you
can see here, we end up with the

NOTE Confidence: 0.846489727497101

2720d726-98f3-4bb3-b16e-2e648815746d
01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:51.180
better system. Instead of
spending 4 pages putting the one

213a761d-9dbc-4fbf-b98e-0d5819c2fb64
01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:56.592
symbol, because we have three
more symbols. I mean 0123, we

0e1c04a9-3b1e-4f1e-b1d2-f0e67c58df4f
01:00:56.592 --> 01:01:02.496
can store the number
12,000 number in just one page.

9e8894f8-1554-4498-8ce3-907a499fac23
01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:09.340
So we end up because of that
number, I mean four times and so

NOTE Confidence: 0.880311608314514

53571bf9-98d3-4264-b521-ec32fcefdf59
01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:15.430
we have four symbols, so we can
save space by the factor of 4.

691fab0b-dc21-4682-bd5b-81b1d5977c20
01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:23.396
So this is a huge improvement to
the unary system, but

01:01:54.295 --> 01:01:59.899
 in Hossein's system we are spending one page about 3000 digits of

 improve Hossein's system.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.289
Uh, the thing was that when we.

f318a40c-2edf-4684-b2f2-b543331780dc
01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:20.210
Or run out of the digits. We
have introduced the new position

bc7e451d-4dc1-44fc-82f3-c12989bf335b
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:24.955
and keep track of what we've
done so far. So here we keep

a62ce9b8-286e-4c51-84c5-0c282be5f3de
01:02:24.955 --> 01:02:31.048
 track of 3. But we could say that we did one round overall of all the

f00a02e3-b3e3-4353-9a3c-070642ac577f
01:02:31.048 --> 01:02:35.328
four symbols. So instead of
just keeping what we've done

5b338608-3aac-4bc9-9a8f-b7589b43bc25
01:02:35.328 --> 01:02:40.036
so far, the three, we can keep
the number of rounds.

3ad60020-20b1-4f7e-a03a-458bcba35d2b
01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:46.573
 For instance, here, when we reach to the 3 3, with it, 2

f57b7f98-feae-412a-8409-26d9969c4f43
01:02:46.573 --> 01:02:50.764
rounds over all the digits. So
instead of just keeping the

9be7aa0c-b4e6-462b-8c47-65a99f71bdc8
01:02:50.764 --> 01:02:55.336
actual digits, we can keep track
of the number of rounds over

c954421c-ed9c-4af1-9475-403f590fb795
01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:59.817
these symbols. That's a smarter
and we can reuse the existing

f801a42d-74a6-4079-873d-51e0a0c3db95

digits one and two.

f91e06a3-a960-4f07-96d1-5dee4e76027f
01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.849
And we can continue this way
here, for instance, to represent

4ed52444-0609-4d56-b6fb-9c672a49b410
01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:13.155
12. We can say that instead of
just saying we did 333, we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.887721002101898

7dc61d90-b4b3-453a-8227-a12aa8537579
01:03:13.155 --> 01:03:17.324
say that we did three runs
over all digits, so four symbols

44f34c78-d6ab-46cb-9d14-885da7560f4f
01:03:17.324 --> 01:03:21.872
and just store the number 3
instead of just 3 * 3.

NOTE Confidence: 0.896418511867523

dbde65ae-036c-441d-9845-942bfd9dc3e7
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:27.785
And we can continue the same to
this 16 for the 16 we can say

NOTE Confidence: 0.896418511867523

84785fa3-7dd3-495c-8a42-0d1614b25529
01:03:27.785 --> 01:03:31.877
that we did four times overall
digits. So let's keep. I mean,

NOTE Confidence: 0.896418511867523

3b15274f-df21-4a45-b616-663d71c22760
01:03:31.877 --> 01:03:33.241
the number of rounds.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897078514099121

a564086a-098f-4925-9bb2-c5464bcd82a5
01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:37.216
So we end up with this

NOTE Confidence: 0.917518496513367

00f4eff5-09e0-4644-a04a-fcb1f3221cd0
01:03:37.216 --> 01:03:40.864
system. So we start with

NOTE Confidence: 0.883541345596313

6ee4f593-2fc6-48bb-b397-934a2014e40d
01:03:40.864 --> 01:03:47.452
0123,
and when we are going to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.883541345596313

20a594ba-5fb5-478a-9bf2-8d51028d4601
01:03:47.452 --> 01:03:50.386
next unit, we introduce new
position to the left.

NOTE Confidence: 0.897571206092834

f91cbd5f-d1c0-40aa-97a7-6fb65e53d546
01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:55.164
But this time, instead of just
keeping the three, we keep the

NOTE Confidence: 0.897571206092834

b5d0f7e6-00b5-47ca-8016-2de3e005a81f
01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:57.186
number of rounds so the 1.

97f262d6-a77d-48dd-88d1-16f39d8d894d
01:03:57.830 --> 01:04:03.134
And remember, this 1 is kind
of is very different from the

ba085bbf-4aac-4edd-9c6d-23a72a6498db
01:04:03.134 --> 01:04:08.780
first 1. Because, uh, we. This
1 means the number of rounds

NOTE Confidence: 0.863959014415741

6ad6fedd-9bea-4ad1-b60b-16cb736ec059
01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.055
which is 4.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905691027641296

b93a874c-7c50-4043-a47a-c6ae6e4f76a3
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.591
I mean rounds over the four
digits, but the first 1 in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.905691027641296

a5c0d811-e097-47c8-a20b-8d9b426aa07a
01:04:15.591 --> 01:04:17.913
first position is only one unit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.861205160617828

797f3700-0e1a-40f8-9309-fdd3468f4941
01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:23.720
So we interpret this 1
in the new position as

NOTE Confidence: 0.861205160617828

4c5fa29a-6268-444c-90d4-9dcffc23a512
01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:27.944
having as a
more significant number.

NOTE Confidence: 0.851468503475189

67cb0830-37b6-4b99-a5be-5d9cbd4c2251
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:35.220
We continue now to the next
count, so the one is 1 round, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.851468503475189

cd50ce57-e442-4c24-b359-09758515d383
01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:39.895
again 10 11 12 and then in this
position we did another round.

NOTE Confidence: 0.851468503475189

a709b9ea-d104-45ff-ba4d-d321e9f70e69
01:04:39.895 --> 01:04:45.420
So we just increment 1 3 and
then you just increment the 1

NOTE Confidence: 0.851468503475189

26dbae65-ea96-4b0a-bb17-a28149aafe57
01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:50.520
to 2. So we did two rounds
instead of just keeping the

NOTE Confidence: 0.851468503475189

28556b7f-ea83-4b4a-82dc-6ba0ceb91a49
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:54.770
three. We said that we increment
the one to two.

NOTE Confidence: 0.907336950302124

fb3f69d1-2a14-4f44-a769-72fb7fc55fce
01:04:56.070 --> 01:05:01.670
So, but this two is more
significant than the two

NOTE Confidence: 0.907336950302124

2cc1cb02-3611-4334-a880-2af4891ea12f
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:03.910
in the first position.

NOTE Confidence: 0.878516972064972

cfd313ba-439e-4cca-9e08-f7b6d309e88d
01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:09.710
So this way instead of just
keeping the fee, we keep track

NOTE Confidence: 0.878516972064972

2e310563-5b8f-47a6-8c28-f6de42c3541b
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:12.870
of the rounds we did over

NOTE Confidence: 0.936934292316437

15f01b56-5f39-4329-8cb6-bfcc5028ecf6
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:17.569
the digits. And then we can
continue this way.

NOTE Confidence: 0.877388179302216

00de9752-a767-4b13-9a6c-b4c0d4d8bd6b
01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:23.786
So my question is this, when we
end up with the 3 3 means

NOTE Confidence: 0.877388179302216

b8a54736-bc8a-4793-a4da-7c53bdad3fef
01:05:23.786 --> 01:05:28.648
that we did three rounds over
all the digits plus 3 units and

NOTE Confidence: 0.877388179302216

e12a2ee9-ef1c-42ca-bee8-3d9df89015c2
01:05:28.648 --> 01:05:33.884
the next step is also in this
step with it 4 rounds, so we

NOTE Confidence: 0.877388179302216

1ad23a69-a4d0-49f5-b965-f844c6403269
01:05:33.884 --> 01:05:38.372
have to represent four rounds,
but we don't have the digit for 4.

NOTE Confidence: 0.881112098693848

37dcdc1a-83b6-4a7f-a303-48d0874cd9fa
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:46.170
So the solution is again we do
the same as we did in the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.881112098693848

83ff33d1-6bac-4173-b0b4-0a8c8d441fc5
01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:50.530
position. So imagine we don't
have the first unit, first

NOTE Confidence: 0.881112098693848

0c0b740e-95c9-4ec7-b3b0-68832bd1c5bb
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:56.198
position, so we did one round
over the digit, but this time in

NOTE Confidence: 0.881112098693848

6ca18879-d823-4731-975f-3c659c223acc
01:05:56.198 --> 01:06:00.558
the second position. So we
introduce a new position one,

NOTE Confidence: 0.881112098693848

62abd5f4-5e2a-4c36-a980-b1d82c4af053
01:06:00.558 --> 01:06:05.354
and then in put a zero in the
all other positions.

72ca7512-5595-4a22-a0d1-43a14d5414f1
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:12.626
So this means that we did one
round over all digits, but in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.899684488773346

db1b6861-6d8f-4f94-9e9d-4b359e776afb
01:06:12.626 --> 01:06:14.102
second significant position.

3191223f-0b2f-4acb-ba49-afc15fbdd869
01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:22.562
And this one has a significant
to the power 4 to the power of

6a48f840-d39e-4272-ab67-8786b6870dcf
01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:26.999
2 because it includes eight
rounds over the digits.

And this is the system that is

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:06.620
So here is the recap. So
when we have one position, the

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:12.210
significant of that position is
equal to 1, so there is no round

39bc1603-4444-4f69-9aec-16ad04bc1fb7
01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:19.090
or zero round, 4 to the power of

9196b9b6-fae3-47b8-bc37-eb9c77a71b63
01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:27.870
But when we
introduce a new position, that

b148c518-3cb3-4545-8524-7d0f47591dd1

it means that two rounds over

2 2 means 10 and we can
continue up until 100. 100 means

So and we can continue for

NOTE Confidence: 0.93620091676712

ab030c6a-f20e-4d2b-ab81-d3c0094221b8
01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:33.910
And see.
What's

NOTE Confidence: 0.93620091676712

79e3f161-e91f-456c-bed3-cfc1934ca0bc
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.200
the

cf23f66b-b036-4327-a873-c5c5beab0583
01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:43.800
solution? So
the number here is 3333.

NOTE Confidence: 0.875674903392792

2610bf6d-626a-47f5-80b3-7ddd2557c39c
01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:47.220
How many three? We have 5 three.

NOTE Confidence: 0.884553670883179

b2b426ac-dba3-4bb3-b4b3-708a7ff43512
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.890
And two. So the first
step is we have to find the

NOTE Confidence: 0.884553670883179

4b2033bf-be87-4988-8f11-0939ae73c105
01:13:54.890 --> 01:14:00.082
significance of the position. So
it's not because this number is

bddcb1f5-9a31-4da5-affe-181e34678d33
01:14:00.082 --> 01:14:05.274
in the base-4 system,
so the significance of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.884553670883179

f683e27e-2bde-49cc-9594-b9767cfe2ee6
01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:10.938
positions is based on the powers
of four. So this significance is

d8a82994-4601-4b30-864c-8750d3092c5e
01:14:10.938 --> 01:14:13.298
 , let me put another colour. This is

0d2a2ce8-7217-43dd-ab60-eed81b693fab
01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:18.280
4 to the power of 0, four to the
power of 1.

ed1c8a77-7410-48dd-bfe1-be6a111812ff

 4 to the power of 3.

30326118-f240-4af7-aab2-fa619ebad744
01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:33.428
And then. 4 to the power of 5
so first you have to determine

3b266143-e63a-4131-b708-7745505ce623
01:14:33.428 --> 01:14:36.884
the significance of the
positions because the number is

dffb18f9-1a5f-47cd-8900-bceaeda7a4f8
01:14:36.884 --> 01:14:41.492
in the base-4 system, so the
significance is based on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.875985264778137

f20949d7-257d-4cc0-862d-65268f471196
01:14:41.492 --> 01:14:45.716
powers of four, so from zero to
5 means six positions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.885074496269226

44c28297-ac83-4aed-a59a-dbfa9327fd28
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:50.960
Then you have to multiply each
digit to the significant

01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:26.610
So. Interesting thing is that

608f3ffa-6e90-4a5e-8876-4f95c6aa64fd
01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:34.410
Google can answer this for
you. So you could say that

7229529c-d569-490d-8f59-ad0832e9e5f8

So if you can see here.

01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:58.550
In Google you can say that let's
calculate this number for me. 2 *

4 to the power of 0 + 3
* 4 to the power of 1 plus three

a79d66a6-4c2a-4df5-92e3-3a10918f0411
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:08.000
multiplied by power of 2.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.144
by 4 to the power of five. 
So let's see the answer

5bcf90b8-c5dd-4163-b03f-f8617fd66351
01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:22.448
It is 4094, so the
correct answer is the first one.

convert these numbers to the

01:16:58.663 --> 01:17:02.876
that these numbers are in the
base-4, so the significance

 And when we are comparing these two systems, Hossein System and

c5a0b7a3-0a85-4afe-8d5a-bee34dc1d0e5
01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:19.648
 You can easily see that the Hossein system is very I mean bad. I

99dbd7c0-e7b7-480a-96be-c4f9212a9194
01:17:19.648 --> 01:17:24.112
mean comparing to the base-4.
First of all, in the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.881492435932159

ffb4fa5c-c47f-4340-abaa-47d6d11ee178
01:17:24.112 --> 01:17:28.630
number. This number is not a
valid number in Hossein system,

NOTE Confidence: 0.881492435932159

6eed4af0-971e-4d7f-8083-95a2185daa36
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:33.805
but it is a valid number in base
four. It means that the base-4

629c21a9-2189-4183-8ae4-8f9b02a75878
01:17:33.805 --> 01:17:37.945
can employ all the possible. I
mean uh, numbers in the given

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:45.535
So although this is not a valid
number, but this is a

3b3d3bb1-0b5f-42a2-af0b-7570e65df19e
01:17:45.535 --> 01:17:47.950
valid number in base-4 and equal to

01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:51.498
65,000 something. Another
interesting thing is that when

b9f05ede-cee5-404d-9568-7de541f4874c
01:17:51.498 --> 01:17:53.338
we are given 10 positions,

NOTE Confidence: 0.903033792972565

f75ef9ad-b1fb-4bdd-a919-fde899aef291
01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:58.786
We can represent a number around
1,000,000 in base-4, but in

b62a9cac-4b5d-4294-90b9-cc075a5b5c75
01:17:58.786 --> 01:18:04.078
 Hossein's system it's just about 39. So you can see that the base-4

8ceb3b2f-2b85-4de3-869f-1aeafd5b20f3
01:18:04.078 --> 01:18:10.334
system. Given the same number of
position or a space is able to

a2ff60a6-ed0c-4d33-861c-6098753356f7

is evidently a better number

c783159a-2244-472d-8965-d976e690e464
01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:21.236
system. And that's the way we
actually improve the numbering

04e306e0-dd4c-498d-874a-70a96b81b6c9

number of digits, and you
introduce your own digits.

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:33.140
And then you have to tell how
can you interpret or how can you

count the units, so you can
introduce position to the right

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:41.940
and then you have your own
symbols. For instance, you could

01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:46.340
have six symbols and your
symbols not necessary haveto be

symbols, but the

01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:54.340
interpretation is important. You
could say that my symbol is

01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:59.140
equal to 0 in decimal system.
This symbol is equal to 1.

01:25:59.210 --> 01:26:03.621
And then I will introduce
position to the right and then

01:26:03.621 --> 01:26:08.032
this is the formulation in
order to map my number system

01:26:08.032 --> 01:26:12.844
to the decimal number system.
So there is no limit to that.
