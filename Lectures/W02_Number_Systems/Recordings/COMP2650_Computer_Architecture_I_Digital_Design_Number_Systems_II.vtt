00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:30.816
start with a recap of what we
covered last session very

9ae091a9-2dfe-4bd5-9453-91bb4bea92fe
00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:35.082
quickly, and then
we'll start on new topics.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.313
Ah, OK, let's start. I mean, we
started with the stars and we

196dc342-4a77-440b-9937-99c3e5db47b0
00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:41.656
said the people in
the old days wanted to travel

55b4c7d5-697b-4f37-9b9a-5680bbfc7c00
00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:46.177
between Earth and those stars to
explore the universe so they

b4ad124b-a21c-48ee-9c25-8c4d50fcec9d
00:01:46.177 --> 00:01:50.698
start some to propose some
problems and one of the most

8060619c-d849-4996-8e1e-70f4b66bfa80
00:01:50.698 --> 00:01:55.219
basic problem is what's the
distance between us and the stars?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8622057

3e1220cb-ca89-411d-b58e-97eadbba4c95
00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.096
And they said that they started to

b0ec4c86-222b-48c1-8e27-22920ff7b077
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.479
Measure the distance of Earth to
the Sun. Last session, we said

NOTE Confidence: 0.83804244

b4a87af0-ea2d-43f3-a929-8eb666add81e
00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.009
that let's pick the distance of the
Moon to the Sun.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682356

3ce4b132-a928-4cb3-aeb0-f46845e820e5
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.105
And, what we did was that. I
mean what all the people in the old

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682356

38ae2d8e-79b5-4ce3-9594-effc5f81a9d8
00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:16.372
days did was that they
brokedown the continuous

1b16764e-4a9a-402f-92cf-629ef773e93f
00:02:16.372 --> 00:02:20.002
quantity which is the distance
into discrete units of Earth.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682356

3feeb17a-c00f-46eb-8710-f997641cd9cc
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:24.721
And then they start to count and
measure by the number of Earth.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682356

f3f8b12a-3c13-4aec-86ae-daa27099ebe7
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:28.714
So by just this illustrative
image, you could say that the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682356

06f07984-a6e0-4d8d-9c07-d762067cfdc6
00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:33.433
the distance of the Moon to
the Sun is about, I mean five

NOTE Confidence: 0.8682356

3cc28640-f596-4925-930c-58ca90a969e4
00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:37.426
Earth. I mean by just some error
or roughly 5 Earth.

581c71e1-aed8-49af-9722-d2f1f8d69796
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.682
And so that was simple. But the
thing is, that's the most

NOTE Confidence: 0.89647365

ea605932-6a3e-4f9a-9cc4-6d96e82e3761
00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:47.822
important step in analyzing any
type of information. I mean

7ba35a2c-b48b-4390-98e1-aefc83b6459a
00:02:47.822 --> 00:02:51.134
breaking down the continuous
quantity into discrete units.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8706644

dfe1dd5f-16a2-433e-ad34-ab34e3a0f9cc
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.100
So that was the birth of the
discrete systems. Computer

bdda18a3-fb1c-46d5-b69e-fdcb2d51fa3e
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.604
system is just a single member
of this huge I mean category.

284b8405-873a-4dbb-9efa-e4e8681abca0
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.540
And then we discuss what are
the other types of. I mean,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637941

ef7690fe-488e-48d4-9176-ea11f61821e9
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.645
what are the other quantities
that are continuous or

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637941

afcba62d-deed-4c71-8674-c14044548b2d
00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:10.750
discrete? We said that for
instance, electron is a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637941

f42fa9af-eeca-468b-b9a3-388e576cc462
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.855
discrete quantity. Time is a
continuous quantity. So in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637941

ebbef296-5fa6-4824-b5f8-62eb65cfb4bb
00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:17.650
order to analyze time in the
computer system, we have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637941

c054579f-8243-44c0-a49d-5f1f918dbb70
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.100
break it down into discrete
units of, for instance, days,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637941

4c1be5a4-af7d-44fe-ac02-4b77a9bde362
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.135
hours or minutes.

66e9174e-25d9-454a-878e-ff90bc80e197
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.160
And in particular for the image
we said that image is a

12dfad97-cbdd-4087-a3fe-c45ae8c626f8
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.410
continuous quantity in the real
world, because it's a reflection

437ba40e-707c-4133-bc66-07ce5fa1fe13
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.710
of light and material.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.230
Uh, so you must say that this
is the first image from

NOTE Confidence: 0.87300694

e1f0ed17-bf70-49e3-ad73-c81abfbda5f9
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.650
I mean years ago and you
could say that how can we

bbcdc532-f609-4fc1-b5b7-ee95dcbe0316
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.710
process image? Or is there a
course called image processing?

NOTE Confidence: 0.87300694

c5db2881-bc59-4966-86a8-d201464ab4a4
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.790
How can we process image in the
computer system? This thing is same

NOTE Confidence: 0.87300694

5df7ee3f-37cd-4166-b7f2-b61f8fe5dd15
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.210
as we did for the distance, we
have to break it into discrete

NOTE Confidence: 0.87300694

d380d70d-9f22-431a-8de4-bd788d26aef8
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.950
units and the discrete units in
images are called pixels, and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.87300694

fda12b16-4956-496d-947c-61f4ecc79cc6
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.630
process that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8804659

3b4c8aa0-8994-493b-b8bd-f551bdb82216
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.988
And after that, after breaking
down this continuous quantity

NOTE Confidence: 0.8804659

40a22878-208d-40eb-8c26-7167c9a6710d
00:04:01.988 --> 00:04:06.509
into discrete units, we said
that the next step is to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8804659

f14aa44c-ed59-4d12-ad04-2540b843ba70
00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:11.852
represent that measurement, you have
to write it down. So in Roman

23e58242-b6c2-46eb-8cb6-fb0218ce648d
00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:16.373
Empire, I mean about 8 centuries
before Christ they start to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8804659

f0eb730b-b9de-4c5d-a009-eff52190fe70
00:04:16.373 --> 00:04:20.072
introduce a symbol for nothing,
they just represent nothing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82275254

5e283715-1952-4974-bacd-fbda308402c0
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.468
For one unit, they invent one
symbol called I, and then for

NOTE Confidence: 0.82275254

b7e47a06-7758-4833-af24-cf2f7e2c65d9
00:04:25.468 --> 00:04:30.200
the next unit. I mean more units.
They just repeat that symbol. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.82275254

b212e0f4-36f7-4b0b-9a4e-c322c1158160
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.568
for the two they put two I for
three, they put three I.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9004209

cd1e321d-f958-49b8-b822-704ca6b75d93
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.416
And then there was another
important step in analyzing

NOTE Confidence: 0.9004209

58eeb992-6bd4-44c1-839b-00f576c68698
00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:43.048
information, so you first
breakdown a continuous entity

NOTE Confidence: 0.9004209

7b0d4dd2-0f17-4ff2-a072-f667ec4657d2
00:04:43.048 --> 00:04:48.042
to discrete units and then you
want to represent those units

NOTE Confidence: 0.9004209

7c2a3940-6049-41a1-a335-5afaabb8d846
00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:53.036
by some symbols or numbers or
digits. The whole process is

NOTE Confidence: 0.9004209

623073fc-ed69-4801-82be-5354bf82c909
00:04:53.036 --> 00:04:53.944
called quantization.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7811584

9d195413-d0da-4f6d-9ffe-02ae6ffeaa4b
00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.492
Then we said that this is
called the Unary system where we

NOTE Confidence: 0.7811584

bb4c5401-44cf-445d-955c-24732baea297
00:05:00.492 --> 00:05:03.018
have only one symbol or base

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824905

61b3ac9a-ac66-47d7-92ee-96a27113dc6e
00:05:03.018 --> 00:05:09.056
one. And based on this system,
we said that if you want to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824905

50144905-f082-448c-959e-587c658221f5
00:05:09.056 --> 00:05:12.986
represent the most distance to
the Sun, the distance is about

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824905

057c0cc6-8499-4932-b3af-71d8a131547b
00:05:12.986 --> 00:05:18.095
12,000 Earth. So we need 12,000
positions or we need to repeat I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824905

4ad5d280-d2ff-4d49-9db6-00e7635d2d21
00:05:18.095 --> 00:05:22.418
12,000 times. So it becomes
about four pages. And that's a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824905

1a496030-f456-4ea2-90aa-e11fcc4e5cfa
00:05:22.418 --> 00:05:25.955
huge number of space just to
represent 1 number, 12,000.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86876

766e1aa1-7af9-4510-bf6f-35b696dc84dc
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.400
Then we said that, is it
possible to improve the Unary

NOTE Confidence: 0.86876

4a3a049c-2437-4bd2-83c0-1a1cce25b3fb
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.275
system? And the answer was yes.
So that was the evolution of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.86876

e0648277-164d-468f-ac39-56290fc0df11
00:05:36.275 --> 00:05:40.025
numbering system within
history. Up until now, we

c627934c-63e2-4509-9960-e049723e27ad
00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:44.900
have 10 symbols and instead of
just one symbol, and as you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.86876

4b33589e-e701-43dd-b091-15c02caf2cbf
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.400
see the at first, there were no
symbols for zero, so gradually

NOTE Confidence: 0.86876

12fd3049-4a7f-4aac-b277-bfce75244c51
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.775
more symbols were added to represent
zero and more units.

7a532f6f-9b45-4602-bec4-29265632ff6d
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.750
And after 24 centuries we have
the decimal system we are using

dc5a0542-47b4-4066-8b26-60c276de0515
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.495
right now in high school or in
the school from 0 to 9.

7e6dba66-e04c-4d95-b223-150ab6f66329
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.044
So then I introduce my
own numbering system to improve

3667f2f6-50fe-49e3-a883-0052a2d48651
00:06:09.044 --> 00:06:13.686
the Unary system, and we saw
that based on the Hossein's system

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637801

1a517b12-d408-4ef6-8f25-d12506648768
00:06:13.686 --> 00:06:19.172
we have four symbols 0123. But we
didn't have any symbol for 4,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637801

f6782310-cc70-460d-bb6e-91c90c71d5d3
00:06:19.172 --> 00:06:25.080
so we have to come up with the
work around to represent 4 by

NOTE Confidence: 0.8637801

abebdc7f-3d79-4ae9-8224-fc32c6bd409f
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.768
the existing symbols 0123.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8723263

ecd63e86-7eb9-468b-b03a-22069a6f8470
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:33.064
And we said that we can do this
by introducing a new position to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8723263

c252d7c9-b196-48f8-bc24-296e6480f781
00:06:33.064 --> 00:06:38.498
the left or right. So then we
discuss how can we count base

NOTE Confidence: 0.8723263

4837c8f8-6684-4498-b6da-38846b0490f5
00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:42.260
on the Hossein system by
introducing position to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8811483

f681db2e-1266-4dc8-9bf9-53173f47c9de
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.170
left. And basically what we did
was that, we keep track

NOTE Confidence: 0.8811483

04263818-42dc-434e-8568-d3a5d4e296a7
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.200
of what we done so far in the last
position and then introduce and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8811483

5e5e07d0-36b2-4262-8aa8-45ad1ed1c783
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.060
start counting on the first

902ab4c9-d16b-47d7-b2ad-e7b7661fee5e
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.798
position. For instance,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8936136

efdc2ddd-93cb-4244-b6d9-7426812d0cfd
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:02.466
for the number 16, we said that
we do one time from zero to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8936136

0adaad14-70ed-4271-b657-b1de28c06150
00:07:02.466 --> 00:07:06.606
three and then another time
zero to three, zero to three, zero to three and then zero.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8936136

bb5a152e-db58-4740-8be0-48e132dd84f8
00:07:06.606 --> 00:07:12.402
So basically 16 is equal to the
sum of all these 3 + 0 and plus

NOTE Confidence: 0.8936136

307d937e-a054-413a-b2f9-31045c5ce73f
00:07:12.402 --> 00:07:16.956
number of positions minus one
because whenever we add a new

NOTE Confidence: 0.8936136

64b4c986-552e-494d-8aa1-644a517aa1a7
00:07:16.956 --> 00:07:19.026
position we take one step.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8875142

2b0a6b0c-4ae3-4f59-ad35-e56097b6e454
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.500
So this is my own system by just
counting whenever we are done

NOTE Confidence: 0.8875142

022070e8-48de-4039-b338-f6d6b6af6646
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.350
with the symbols, we introduce
new positions and this is the

a4ee6a50-b78a-4fe1-9003-8d8852cf2ba6
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.800
math formula we came up with.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87971675

34af8b20-a1b8-4925-93d9-0f385ff49a1d
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.164
And then we said that if you're
giving some numbers in in

0e9e694e-ae04-4754-8a88-2e1f98d153a5

numbering system,
what's the equal

d2760ad2-36ac-48b1-b93b-1ec0d148fd99
00:07:39.197 --> 00:07:43.578
value in the decimal system and
based on what I said, first, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.87971675

7e207bab-24a5-4f6d-9677-816003b60717
00:07:43.578 --> 00:07:47.285
have to check whether that
number is a valid number and

NOTE Confidence: 0.87971675

b9a2f743-7919-4b99-8d8e-76abdbf3ee43
00:07:47.285 --> 00:07:48.970
then start converting to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.866758

0f2a084d-22ad-4d38-8fe8-493fade835c2
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.942
decimal system. For instance,
this number was not a valid

NOTE Confidence: 0.866758

e936ce60-71e5-43a2-9c62-3e7d7681d956
00:07:52.942 --> 00:07:55.903
number because in Hossein's
system, whenever you introduce a

NOTE Confidence: 0.866758

41e5be71-3785-4283-87ee-328b82d2b8ec
00:07:55.903 --> 00:07:59.851
new position, you have to end
with the largest digit which is

NOTE Confidence: 0.866758

795fba24-5555-40d3-8fe9-0c906a255292
00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:02.154
3. So you cannot have such a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8617281

77703d89-c64f-466a-bde8-50272f2cb090
00:08:02.154 --> 00:08:08.620
number 303. Uh, but this was a
valid number 33331, and in order

NOTE Confidence: 0.8617281

5d5a0686-6e77-4cb0-a938-71bc3459eafd
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:14.470
to see what's the equal value in
decimal system we have to just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8617281

2e38d0b1-d28e-4d10-b349-a1382f8fc8e8
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.870
sum all the digits plus number
of positions minus one, so this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8617281

9e2f0f99-61eb-43a5-a507-efb635c11cf2
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.020
is equal to 17, and more symbols.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

83afabf5-d84d-4b22-af3f-364776d529b6
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.333
And then for any numbering
system, we said that we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

2128826e-ebaf-479b-a0a4-8c2bc2bf0403
00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:31.420
calculate the minimum value,
which is just repeating the

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

b827f5f9-dd32-4f80-8166-cc8f6e182ccf
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.507
zero, the lowest digit, in
all positions and the

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

f1bf51ba-535d-4ba4-af75-9175b53f7929
00:08:34.507 --> 00:08:37.594
maximum is just repeating
the largest digit in all

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

d7b0e7a0-49c7-4ef6-93c7-3d5420d43aeb
00:08:37.594 --> 00:08:41.024
positions. So in Hossein's
system, if you're given N

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

6bb4ae34-ddce-4f4b-a176-d2f804f5225d
00:08:41.024 --> 00:08:44.797
positions, the maximum
number would be 4 * N - 1

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

f828d90a-2f8c-4a88-80c8-9931bd761634
00:08:44.797 --> 00:08:48.570
because we have to add
all the threes plus the number of

NOTE Confidence: 0.88205165

10623feb-a032-487d-83c4-19dbdef3b1c7
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.599
position minus one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8594805

f2220812-115f-4f23-9353-dd30d9fb9f02
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.239
So we did that and then we
saw that if you're giving 10

NOTE Confidence: 0.8594805

440a6ef6-83ec-4f70-8b54-e1369c195ac7
00:08:55.239 --> 00:08:58.326
positions, the maximum number
in Hossein System is going

23bcadbb-02af-44af-9c0d-e2d01225e981
00:08:58.326 --> 00:09:02.099
to be 39, which is a very
small number, so Hossein's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8594805

40b49455-aeb2-4e31-8eda-ac76d28c8f50
00:09:02.099 --> 00:09:05.529
system is able to represent a
very small range of numbers.

1c42133e-d16b-4222-a31e-a35056b4f3ba
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.618
And we said that if you're
given a number in decimal

NOTE Confidence: 0.87413055

8b077d77-0a7a-476c-9ea4-02f2f517a987
00:09:10.618 --> 00:09:14.790
system and we want to represent
it in a new number

NOTE Confidence: 0.87413055

154f5cea-504d-483b-acd3-39940156342c
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.068
system such as for Hossein's number
system. How many positions do

NOTE Confidence: 0.87413055

5b661eaa-ab27-4399-8f10-71d7f447032b
00:09:18.068 --> 00:09:21.942
we need? And the solution is that
we just take that number, the

NOTE Confidence: 0.87413055

6708a3b6-62fe-4025-b3ea-36f7d001f349
00:09:21.942 --> 00:09:23.432
given number, as the maximum

NOTE Confidence: 0.8476928

e187a752-f180-41c8-8cd8-dc8800a42748
00:09:23.432 --> 00:09:27.780
number. And you already knew
that the maximum number is equal

NOTE Confidence: 0.8476928

be869811-76cc-4128-b953-d3b353a0dc79
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:33.332
to 4 * N - 1, so with just little
math, we keep the number of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8476928

c7893331-842f-4869-973d-5c2be3b34ae0
00:09:33.332 --> 00:09:37.149
positions to the right and
everything to the left. So the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8476928

1963d97e-b208-406d-8089-2a83c17407d8
00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:40.966
number of positions in Hossein
system in order to represent the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8476928

d9166546-6947-4761-bd14-4e94511a539a
00:09:40.966 --> 00:09:44.783
number N, capital N, is equal to N
+ 1 / 4.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.498
And then based on this, we
wanted to represent

NOTE Confidence: 0.8287481

80720e50-9236-4725-9808-636188a68ec1
00:09:50.498 --> 00:09:54.117
the most distance
to the Sun, but this time with

217a9c4e-12a6-4c44-b827-a75be859b11d
00:09:54.117 --> 00:09:58.394
Hossein's system and we saw that
it is a little bit better

NOTE Confidence: 0.8287481

8deb1bb0-6495-4eaf-af8d-a944341067db
00:09:58.394 --> 00:10:00.039
than the Unary system because

NOTE Confidence: 0.86374104

fee23f7a-97cf-4394-984e-6d9e7c73fe1a
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.790
in order to represent 1000,
we only need 3000 positions and

NOTE Confidence: 0.86374104

9ec8f117-094f-4079-9988-1af0e57651b8
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:09.860
3000 position is just one page of paper, so
we can reduce 4 pages to one

NOTE Confidence: 0.86374104

b3e4c9f3-bd5a-47e2-a765-5d8c5b9543f0
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.930
page, and we said that is it
possible to improve Hossein's

NOTE Confidence: 0.86374104

378a8190-bc6b-463d-bfe5-83cdbbee6938
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.610
system? I mean more, and we said
that the answer is yes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86040765

bd89ecff-1f3b-470d-b5f5-d9a8a3a8a111
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.773
Instead of just keeping track of
what we passed through the

e6c9e6d4-0936-48d9-8a58-eeefa4a09760
00:10:24.773 --> 00:10:29.249
symbols, we can keep track of
the rounds over the symbols. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.86040765

de0b6074-937a-425c-a40d-79d11e05993b
00:10:29.249 --> 00:10:33.352
when, for instance we go
0123, we done one round over

NOTE Confidence: 0.86040765

ffb08aa6-e8a2-44b3-8901-e78181b7d831
00:10:33.352 --> 00:10:37.828
all the digits. So instead of
just keeping the last digit, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.86040765

1e3ea9e9-0c84-41e2-aef2-c3bb1efc9e19
00:10:37.828 --> 00:10:42.677
keep track of the number of
rounds. So we said that we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.86040765

c69d1b97-3339-4b0d-b2e0-e7470e28c87a
00:10:42.677 --> 00:10:47.899
have this, so when we step from
three to four, we say that this is one

NOTE Confidence: 0.86040765

65705f96-d98e-40ea-b692-b4e0f837b649
00:10:47.899 --> 00:10:52.002
round over all the digits and
then zero, so 1 0 becomes

NOTE Confidence: 0.8899741

69d06a4c-c20e-4504-af5b-fd30c354c984
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.210
4 in this new system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88946

e6ca1dbb-81ab-4f1b-a842-3bb29adce92d
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.598
And the difference is that in
this new system, if we introduce a

NOTE Confidence: 0.88946

9bdcc203-c8da-4d88-94e4-70bc734af652
00:10:59.598 --> 00:11:02.670
new position, that position
has a higher significance. As

NOTE Confidence: 0.88946

4d5e67b6-b280-4ef0-91f1-5651738ee2ae
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.662
you can see here, this one means
that one round over all the

NOTE Confidence: 0.88946

47a204b7-de2a-4239-be64-fd93c1acc05f
00:11:07.662 --> 00:11:12.270
digits, which is four digits.
But this one is in the first

12c73cc5-b9d8-49a0-80f0-bcaf8b6b449e
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:17.262
position, meaning that just
one is just one step. So this 1 in

NOTE Confidence: 0.88946

8af0b10c-33d2-4bdb-82d6-3bef107c7a38
00:11:17.262 --> 00:11:21.486
the higher significant position
has a significance of four or 4

NOTE Confidence: 0.88946

f874da6d-0959-4962-b7c1-fc5567167f1a
00:11:21.486 --> 00:11:23.406
to the power of 1.

84e8a637-95c6-4045-9947-b26c537f1048
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:31.656
So we did continue this way in
order to count up until 16 and

NOTE Confidence: 0.86282784

1f87d116-22d7-41ae-9425-ca4b4b11c4a6
00:11:31.656 --> 00:11:36.696
then we call this system the
quaternary system which has only

49f1655a-8186-45e2-8f30-ca603d45e22e

four symbols 0123.

979abdab-b249-44a4-8979-0a134438f3c4
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.230
And because it has four
symbols, we call it base-4 or

NOTE Confidence: 0.8514904

12c781f1-b0eb-4623-9999-622060023298
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.958
radix four symbols, and the
difference, the main

291bac3f-badb-4f58-9564-e418d770052e
00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.027
difference is that when we
introduce new position, the

daab05b3-8e48-429e-9490-cda0493845ce
00:11:48.027 --> 00:11:48.709
positions have

584ee344-e4a6-4fc0-9b00-70319160769a
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.067
significance, and because we have

00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:57.038
four symbols, we do around
over 4 symbols. So the

00:11:57.038 --> 00:11:59.926
significance are based on the
powers of four.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.804
So the first position has the
significance for the power of 0,

9d97ebd8-4577-4093-81a8-685a786571ac
00:12:04.804 --> 00:12:09.802
which is 1. So it's just normal,
0 is equal to 0 to decimal

00:12:09.802 --> 00:12:14.443
system. One same. Two same. Three

00:12:14.443 --> 00:12:18.727
four for the next step, you have to
introduce new position

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.904
And then in order to come up with,
for instance, what's the equal

b10879f9-9c03-475a-8282-fd4f13420ec5
00:12:26.904 --> 00:12:30.288
value in decimal system for 1
0? It means that one multiplied

e6aa769c-2a2e-42e0-8448-ef8a233c4562
00:12:30.288 --> 00:12:31.698
by the significance of the

position. Plus 0 multiplied by
the significance of the

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.120
position for the zero, so it

a8ce5c88-f2a5-407e-be99-602c71e9908f
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.130
becomes 4. For 2 0 in base-4
system, 2 multiplied by 4 to

c93b2bf0-1017-481b-a541-9ecc8ff5ec59
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:47.162
the power of 1 because two is

2fdf08ed-1d06-45cc-ad59-4f47283c6d95
00:12:51.866 --> 00:12:53.882
So in total it becomes 8.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:13:00.220
And then new positions, 4 to the

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.755
these numbers in the Hossein

e378c596-6e3f-4da3-8635-af2f8091d1f7
00:13:32.565 --> 00:13:36.825

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:56.305
And then when we do this for
all the other numbers, we saw

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:14.495
positions and then we have to
multiply each digit with the

00:18:14.495 --> 00:18:18.865

b5a42578-5b20-4a1e-9aa3-eabbccc7b83f
00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:20.613

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.079
So by math.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:51.250
And then I would say that 4
the power of 0, 4 to the power of 1 plus up until 4

d087264d-17f3-46f1-8fc3-caf5489e7bff
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:59.178
So this is a geometric series.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.684
With the ratio 4, so just to

You can keep the three and so the

log 4 on 12,000 + 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8865029

d3e351e7-2f70-458f-9626-8f5ff99f3a3c
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.598
But the only issue here is that
usually the calculators have log

NOTE Confidence: 0.8865029

9400eb78-8af3-4e43-ac18-05d7fbd3a8ab
00:25:55.598 --> 00:25:56.750
base on 10.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85584587

0433fff7-c6c8-40ab-83c1-4158c243a6f1
00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:02.182
So how can
we apply a log on a base of

fa4f58d2-1b89-4e95-ad74-503cf569c18b
00:26:02.182 --> 00:26:05.215
four? If you are given a
normal calculator?

NOTE Confidence: 0.93816006

14902112-a2ee-4635-9b58-c3458dbc85c1
00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:07.878
So that's the issue.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039552

4b6d2788-f27d-42d2-aef0-56ad7cefd058
00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.468
So let's see the answer so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82121444

70230c46-45db-45bd-b009-50073b12256a
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:20.854
Ah, yes, actually. Travis

bffde920-1039-4ada-b94d-86f999666798
00:26:20.854 --> 00:26:26.958
answer to that, so I'll show you
how we can apply log 4 when

NOTE Confidence: 0.82121444

130a1783-eafe-444a-a93c-6bbe946eca12
00:26:26.958 --> 00:26:29.138
the calculator has log N.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93537

77c0b978-2249-4486-b03e-dcad14950a13
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.448
So let's let's move
on to the answer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9165812

762832c7-dd38-46dc-82c8-9b9fbfc26572
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:40.050
OK, 50% so let's see
what's the answer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876802

ca3be26c-cdad-4ac3-80fa-74359f4a6ff2
00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:47.398
The answer is based on our
formula. We already knew that. I

NOTE Confidence: 0.876802

e8feac0c-87e2-4ee3-a7e9-205db13e98e7
00:26:47.398 --> 00:26:51.706
mean the distance of Moon to the
Earth is about 150 million

NOTE Confidence: 0.876802

010c2ac4-2558-4738-a208-ae20c7911b43
00:26:51.706 --> 00:26:56.014
kilometers and the diameter of
the Earth is about 13,000. So we

NOTE Confidence: 0.876802

0fb6db2a-768b-4da4-9d38-8ff87ad40fd8
00:26:56.014 --> 00:26:59.963
need to have 1000. So you just
need to represent 12,000.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9007094

be502fe9-82c3-4861-8508-a8f5efdb2b77
00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.696
So we assume that the maximum
number is 12,000 and based on

NOTE Confidence: 0.9007094

5f425690-2886-499a-9a81-f86619c38b71
00:27:04.696 --> 00:27:08.469
the base-4, the number of
position is equal to log

ae1310e3-192a-475f-9e7b-5e863af6e135
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.010
N + 1. N is 12,000 + 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8359816

f676e42d-83d7-4ec2-aefe-dc20424d8b32
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.884
But based on the base of four,
so the calculators has log

b4418d5b-dbdc-4c0d-8490-53ffab103e7d
00:27:17.884 --> 00:27:24.002
based on the 10. So based on
math we know that log a.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8727073

7965d16b-f9ec-44d6-942d-03df1940dc20
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:30.468
On a base of b is equal to log a
on a base of 10 divided by log

NOTE Confidence: 0.8727073

6612aa1b-cfd5-47b4-b444-ee45113655eb

b on the base of 10.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8831017

6f01f114-d4f4-47c4-9ac2-6da45c1821b2
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:38.325
So here we assume that a is
equal to 12,000 + 1 and b is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8831017

6c465ebb-7091-4e6e-9868-ca20bdd2b24c
00:27:38.325 --> 00:27:42.888
equal to four. So we can simply
calculate the log 12001 on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8831017

04cacba9-ec42-4212-b4ed-8eb837b5218c
00:27:42.888 --> 00:27:47.100
base of 10 divided by log 4 on a
base of 10.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89665836

7602ea21-2cd1-4fe3-aac0-e24caf5c796f
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:54.520
And this is equal to
4 / 0.6 and it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8979083

78da9364-d1c0-44dd-97cb-8b6b63c84346
00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:00.540
about 6.79. Which is equal to
around seven position. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.8979083

78a4dff3-8212-49c0-aaf7-7d8c4e7245f4
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.790
when we are representing the

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.560
distance 12,000 we need about
seven positions, so less

1b46b9c3-55a2-44a0-9a0b-4b8b5e03b876
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.740
than a page is the correct
answer. Just seven position we

e25cb0ba-6225-42e2-afbf-4bf68912a1d2
00:28:18.276 --> 00:28:23.050
we need seven position, and when

decimal system to the base-4,
it becomes equal to 2323200.

00:28:39.326 --> 00:28:44.240
other systems such as base-4

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.020
we convert from decimal system

larger number of symbols.
For instance, instead of just

00:30:08.368 --> 00:30:11.689

have two or three symbols.

9beff2b9-59aa-40b7-b39a-40d33ae5ef0f
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:17.702
Or in other systems we had only

there's some numbering system

00:30:33.381 --> 00:30:38.169
that are very common and used in

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:53.250
The first one is the base-2 or
radix 2, because it has only two

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.783
So in Binary system or base-2
system we have only two symbols,

zero and one. And.

66d8a942-8461-4e4c-ae8e-489ec78edfab
00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:10.304
If you are given
a series of digits.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.488
And we are, we assume that this

c9b21afd-2ff4-41da-8a2e-4b9d02fb835a
00:31:15.488 --> 00:31:18.894
have to check that the digits
are valid. So we see that all

bba32f55-9288-461f-a1ae-01870eb075dd
00:31:18.894 --> 00:31:22.300
the digits are zero or one, so
we don't have any other digits

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.444
such as two or three or
something, because we are in a

00:31:25.444 --> 00:31:31.720
binary system. And then we have
to measure the

c1482dac-9c3f-4838-b60c-f709623af641
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.560
significance of each position.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.740
So from the first position to

44c2a07f-cd33-4b44-83f7-f5b29ccad12c
00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.490
calculate the significance of
the position. Because we are in

cf033aea-547d-4b2b-8aee-6d5299b5b091
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:47.740
the base-2 system, we have only
two digits. We do rounds over 2

2e62136b-e030-4966-b37a-6e41ebed4fe0
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:51.865

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:58.198
So we start from 2 to the

bd40d2e4-ab5d-40d5-9216-836aa387af73
00:31:58.198 --> 00:32:02.657
up until to the power of

c664e15a-f075-4850-ae1b-2515e54f3a1d
00:32:02.657 --> 00:32:06.087
we multiply each digit to the
significance of each position

add4b069-b686-4776-9f09-7e57c7dcf727
00:32:06.087 --> 00:32:09.174
and then we just sum together,
so this number,

eaf49e75-9ea5-43b2-8099-26d008576e93
00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:16.010

7a4ef8ce-c76b-4ddb-8fa7-cd0c894aa73f
00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:26.743
calculate what's the actual

eabae65e-58e7-47d7-9fb0-fe8fd81575a7
00:32:26.743 --> 00:32:30.253
again, we put the significance

00:32:30.253 --> 00:32:34.465
then we do the multiplication.
But the thing is before that we have

91afe7cf-5828-42e1-94ab-5b3461b23da2
00:32:34.465 --> 00:32:36.571
to check the digits are valid.

c30fd182-42c8-432b-b624-7ca670998b98
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.472
As you can see here we have a
digit such as two and three

413edf0b-f767-4f56-aafa-d6aeb169be6f
00:32:41.472 --> 00:32:44.860
which are not valid digits in
Binary system, so we cannot

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.940
convert it to the decimal

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.020
that this is not a valid

a11cd446-2de2-4d4d-9c9f-c5518357fa77
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.520
So now because Binary system is
very important in computer

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.830
And let's count
on binary system.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:24.907
When I was a student I tried to
repeat this process again and

00:33:24.907 --> 00:33:30.493
again in order to just memorize
it so whenever I see a series of

00:33:30.493 --> 00:33:35.281
binary digits. I can simply say
what's the equal value in

the decimal system so I suggest
you to do this, or repeat. This

least the last digit when we
are given four positions.

aedf35ae-e2d1-43b3-a9ef-4249eea0d815
00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:51.370
So.

c45ee575-6bf3-42cd-91c8-c6ae910ae240
00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.780
As you can see here we are
given four positions.

6a136d73-c8da-4bee-9907-d3d85a3b4fda
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.430
So the significance of the
positions are based on powers

af93add6-2fc1-4344-9aaf-f8b09dc5cc95
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:13.358
of two, so 2 to the power of

NOTE Confidence: 0.82255703

07a27f61-e65b-483b-8960-6bc1c17d59c0
00:34:13.358 --> 00:34:17.054
to the power of two and two
to the power of 3.

8dc0ed36-7fa6-4020-8e9f-6530163b31bc
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.848
And then you start counting.

a559cb4a-af99-4ed7-8c8a-d91a77136823
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:28.044
So the first number is 0 and if
we include zero in other

NOTE Confidence: 0.8916031

08ab9ea8-d818-455d-ac61-5857a9b0561a
00:34:28.044 --> 00:34:32.224
positions, it doesn't have any
impact because 0 multiplied by

e9fbe2ac-9722-428c-b8c6-34d1e4f468f9
00:34:32.224 --> 00:34:38.076
any number is equal to 0. So
this number is equal to 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8651797

6b4b22e7-ded3-44e1-8125-38984fea2c36
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:43.254
So we just put here
the decimal value.

NOTE Confidence: 0.92601013

a014825a-f661-450a-a941-a2fd0accca55
00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:47.800
So it's equal to 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8975619

2d9691cb-5e9f-42ad-b1d8-00a9ed4cce31
00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:54.118
The next step is 0 + 1
becomes one, so in all other

positions, 0.

720b0190-1fa7-40cc-9b87-90b4af30da07
00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:03.142
Next is this number plus one. So
one unit further. So this plus

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:09.055
So if I plus this with another
one, it becomes 2.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87849224

b1c3b164-2f59-44cf-af69-fb9b575f7d29
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:16.250
But two is not a valid number in
a binary system, so in order to

4fb932d3-3030-4246-a1ed-3d324ae1dd08
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:20.012
make it valid we have to
break it down into

8ef16fc2-cd79-45e3-98fb-a2d55fec9572
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:25.980
Base two, 0s and 1s.
So we just divide 2

NOTE Confidence: 0.8707034

a5e968a4-b227-46ce-b6db-a0bcb7c33b42
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:32.320
By two, it becomes one and
the remainder is equal to

0fa1f8d4-7129-4fc0-893a-ea7d33669efb
00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.840
0. So we put this remainder
on a result and then we

53c78825-33e4-400f-90c1-8ef0a7e91a8d
00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.140
consider this as the carry.

NOTE Confidence: 0.852273

b4b73cec-8b7b-4617-a2d9-e3b4c967ad5a
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:46.610
As we did for the decimal system
in high school, so then this carry

c83536f1-566b-42f5-bed7-3f3ccd4c5b0b
00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:51.230
goes to the next symbol so that
1 + 0 becomes one.

affe60ae-32cc-4ac7-96cb-c58c84ce11cc
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.018
And so the other

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.810
positions are zero.

b13757b2-d39c-4c1f-93eb-d6f138f687ba
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:06.085
So now we have two. The next is
three, so 2 + 1. So we have to

1b622c1a-8091-468b-982f-9e3b8d0f22b5
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:12.060
sum this with just one.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:20.870
So if you do this sum,
0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 0 = 1, 0 + 0 = 0 plus zero is 0,

NOTE Confidence: 0.90233195

965dfcea-a375-4798-bc64-708ec92c0179
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.930
so this is three.

ee96c2a5-f234-4241-81b2-d48ac7dee212
00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:25.150
So.

dccb0bfc-e25c-4491-99a5-a7e5870ea0bf
00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:36.963

So, 4 is 3 + 1.

6f3d2218-cac7-454c-9510-beb1eefaee2d
00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:44.920
1 + 1 becomes 2, Two is
zero with a carry.

1 + 1 becomes 2 plus 0 becomes two

Two is zero with a carry.

And now 1 + 0 becomes

f26a22a3-ed62-4d04-ab22-83f7304529ff
00:36:58.648 --> 00:37:02.180
1, 0 + 0 = 0. So this is 4.

fb39c873-ae37-4c4e-a050-e47f1c2c62ad
00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.915

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.468
So let me go back to the slides.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.450
OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9316554

8107a5d8-b919-4ae2-8f9c-da7bc2d0a43b
00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:54.840
OK.

cdb12325-6577-48b7-a2bd-1e10d0d4a5e2
00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.469
So let's move on to the next

NOTE Confidence: 0.87584573

5969cb12-56f0-49f1-b12a-0bf1db901d70
00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:04.086
numbering system. So we already
covered the base-4, so we

NOTE Confidence: 0.87584573

42313ab4-c4c4-45d7-8cd2-d5b7cac9b1e0
00:40:04.086 --> 00:40:09.462
have base-2, base-4 and now
we have base-8 where we have

a7f45d0e-2bb8-4924-ac44-b4832bb3ab26
00:40:09.462 --> 00:40:14.454
only 8 digits from zero up
until seven. Again. As you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.87584573

26b394aa-784e-4c1e-a067-f6b95c8e2625
00:40:14.454 --> 00:40:19.446
see here, the largest digit is
number of the base minus one. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.87584573

5cf19708-30f2-4253-a82c-17ce3947fe50
00:40:19.446 --> 00:40:24.822
8 - 1 becomes 7, so that's the
largest digit. So in order to

4166b92c-b61f-40fd-bb28-aef5252ac6a6
00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:28.278
have maximum number we have to
repeat this data.

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:33.090
So the same rule
applies. So imagine you are

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:37.650
given this number this time
in base-8. First of all, this

NOTE Confidence: 0.88877636

27893aa9-7c99-49ec-8e75-0ebd4534a976
00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:41.450
is a valid octary number
because all the digits are

64782af6-1602-409a-b956-0632bfa94787
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:42.970
between zero and seven.

b65a9bca-1cda-4665-9dbb-ebfbcd75b5c4
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:49.002
And in order to see what's the
actual value in decimal system,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8852636

d1965c6c-4a6d-4da4-99dc-c3f8167c26b8
00:40:49.002 --> 00:40:52.712
we just have to calculate the
significance of the positions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8852636

becc16ad-6bd2-4c61-8089-b2c45044c1c5
00:40:52.712 --> 00:40:57.164
Because we are in the base
8, we do rounds over 8

NOTE Confidence: 0.8852636

0e8c5f94-8a91-4bc3-9b34-e1a1305042ba
00:40:57.164 --> 00:41:01.245
digits. So the significance are
based on the powers of eight.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8939892

2359756f-f8b1-4225-82fc-e109b454b6b7
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:06.000
So from 8 to the power of 0, 8 to
the power of 1 up until 8 to the

878cd9ea-547f-4927-b2a1-3d87b21a8c79
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.865
power of 7. And then we do
multiplication with each digit

09ff540a-7dbb-461f-a569-c35522984e45
00:41:09.865 --> 00:41:12.880
to the significance of the
position and then sum.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.816
 So this is the actual value, 6,390,873 (NOTE: 57,508,953 IS A MISTAKE!)

00:41:30.748 --> 00:41:35.480
again you have to 1st figure out
if the numbers is a valid number. As

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.930
I have a digit A and a digit 8 
which are not valid

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:59.172
digits are 0, 1 up until 7,
so be careful about this when

final exam. So when you are
given for instance in base-2,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8692453

4c59b327-7913-43ff-ac32-2636126acbef
00:42:10.006 --> 00:42:14.682
the last digit is one. In base-4, the
last digit is 3 and in base

08198fe3-c2d4-4fcc-a181-b6c681dd4e5f
00:42:14.682 --> 00:42:18.356
eight the last digit is 7. So be
careful about that.

the base-2, we wanna see if
we are given the same number in

00:42:29.434 --> 00:42:33.658
the base-8. What would be
the number? So this is the

each digit to the significance

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.880
You at home you can

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:30.760
count 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and then when

bd007fb6-f69d-4b5f-84dd-6273aa3302e5
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:59.934
divide 8 by 8, so it's equal

5e7295a7-de7d-474c-9e88-7adcf5dd8302
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:04.152
zero, so you put the remainder

d20d9424-bb8e-4e66-ae01-2e330cc45538
00:45:04.152 --> 00:45:10.677
here. And then put the quotient
as they carry to the next

00:45:17.138 --> 00:45:22.605
no carrying, so 0. So eight
becomes 10 in base-8, the

divide it by 8, keep the

So.

ad53b242-40d2-4619-b514-fff962be1145
00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:19.812
This is base-8 and the next
is base-10 and we already are

00:46:19.812 --> 00:46:23.842
familiar with the decimal
system. We have 10 digits from

00:46:23.842 --> 00:46:29.081
zero, again, 10 - 1 becomes 9,
so the largest digit is 9.

f5484ba5-44c6-4ffe-9c39-9ebd8e3702d7
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:35.090
And this is the system

415c250d-f9e0-4cdf-a390-15fa5dd77cb4
00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.340
Again, if you're given this
number in decimal system, we

4b8b94d3-e8c9-4089-86ae-8048db1e5f1d

00:47:07.004 --> 00:47:11.999
we are in the base-10, so it's
based on the powers of 10 and

00:47:11.999 --> 00:47:15.329
then we multiply each digit by

00:47:17.993 --> 00:47:22.655
because we are in the base-10
so the powers of 10 is the

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.010
The interesting
thing is that when you do this,

141939da-a327-402e-afd0-ba7b8c2d9804
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.340
you end up with the same

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:38.670
30,302,131 is equal to 30,000,000
something in decimal. So when

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:43.866
you do this calculation, you end

00:47:43.866 --> 00:47:46.031
numbers. So in decimal system,

1091b303-0dcf-4fe4-944f-42ad12acccd3
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.820

1368771c-5c5e-44ef-86b2-fac8b1eeeb5e
00:47:53.524 --> 00:47:56.904
converting the decimal to

00:48:04.124 --> 00:48:08.996
for the base-2 base-8 in
the base-10. You don't need any

cabe3bd2-4de9-4f48-9993-52b125c34bdf
00:48:08.996 --> 00:48:13.172
calculation because you will end

f27daf90-8cdf-4687-95ab-04c33cad4d35
00:48:13.172 --> 00:48:17.395
10,000,000 something. So it's
not just doing the calculation,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8933192

c3f528c7-0d81-4dab-a21e-841305f8b12d
00:48:17.395 --> 00:48:21.850
you can just say that this is

eb9ac3a5-6766-46ac-8ab4-107f888e7422

96e20e2e-abba-454e-a685-105e91fee47c
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.480

base-2 base-8 and base-10,
you can see that.

0d64340a-8486-48a3-8933-b33ab3e5cd25
00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:39.952

00:48:58.764 --> 00:49:02.808
you have to check first if the

bb7f4d97-df76-4f12-8e1f-d603accc8614
00:49:02.808 --> 00:49:07.863
because we have a A is not a

613ebff5-a154-4e80-99fb-d7b4bc10ace3
00:50:06.344 --> 00:50:10.998
which is 15. So in this system
when they represent 15 they put

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:22.875
10 is A.

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:30.494

c1600d61-07b3-44cb-9acf-1afb6509f9bd
00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:36.098
because  We are in the base

38e47969-e4d9-4863-aba9-6cbb5f417b40
00:50:36.098 --> 00:50:41.702
based on the powers of 16. So we
first calculate the significance

NOTE Confidence: 0.8823922

bc249cda-c789-4eaf-a3db-233c97425851
00:50:41.702 --> 00:50:46.839
and then we multiply each digit
to the significance of the

bae7f280-cca0-4295-b71f-d82cc55b2741
00:50:46.839 --> 00:50:49.641

9e7449fb-dbb6-4d57-9967-206608e55c06
00:50:49.641 --> 00:50:55.678
together. You might wonder how
can we multiply a by 16 to the

00:50:55.678 --> 00:50:58.102
power of five, as I said.

a3c70fcd-1d6f-4ccd-aad3-f39ebc3631a1
00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:00.548
A is 1.

9c39818e-6f11-409b-bc48-757debfd15a5
00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:07.115
Step after 9 so it becomes 10,
so the actual value of a is 10.

671e607b-de77-40d5-a176-cd99043fd87d
00:51:07.115 --> 00:51:12.533
So you can convert A to 10 and
then multiply 10 by 16 to the

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:31.880
Again, if you are, if you see B,B
means next step after a which is

00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:48.955

cd589798-ad93-4620-b2c5-ea384524ce80
00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:51.220
So we have 4 one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8995056

c52bd41a-9e63-409d-b08a-6cd87c34ec6b
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.599
We want to know what's

the next number after
that to next numbers.

08bcef67-4446-4370-9234-da1d835de48c
01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:33.490
So because we are in Radix 2,
the first I mean option is not

NOTE Confidence: 0.84925944

140fbe83-1300-4662-be8a-61eda2bbbb37
01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:37.945
correct because we have digits
more than one so the first

d6e80ba4-1801-4ef4-b4eb-6b1276e1e9f4
01:00:37.945 --> 01:00:42.805

1112, but this is not a valid

number in Radix 2.

1ec4d44b-7655-4cbf-af76-fb31f53e3b6e
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:48.780
Also this one. So the first
choice is not correct.

f8d31210-5f6a-4dbc-a9df-1837d37ea5e5
01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:53.344
The last choice also is not

01:00:53.344 --> 01:00:57.112
digits two, so these are not
a valid number radix too, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.8691389

36afabba-c458-4b7f-9bd3-9fb7764bda44
01:00:57.112 --> 01:00:59.938
the only options are the
second and third option.

f123b39c-8b6e-4db7-8ded-5c13dc24dd73
01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:01.900
So.

ff45bbe0-d5b2-432f-862f-0e5b6ae7bca3
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:09.597
When we do this calculation, so
let's uh, share my camera.

b28b77db-0ad4-40ab-8083-758fc8aef96f
01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.578
And let's see what's the answer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7827548

5b596478-ca0c-4a20-9749-8a245cbb8714
01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:32.594
So 1111 you wanna do the
next number so we have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7827548

11596f00-13b6-425b-ba55-acee8cdf4c3e
01:01:32.594 --> 01:01:34.460
plus this why?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7170109

c51085cd-9796-408a-9011-c53c73745cdc
01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:35.920
Digit 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9027865

ec8bc48f-84bf-41f8-bab3-231bab58b914
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:44.070
So 1 + 1 becomes 2, Two is not a
valid digit, so we have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9027865

4351e5ee-bbcc-4c1c-8df9-34c7d992ae2e
01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:49.245
divide it by two because we are
in the base, two is equal to 1

NOTE Confidence: 0.9027865

436d82c9-e4a4-4a4f-ac6c-b3ed3bc801d3
01:01:49.245 --> 01:01:50.970
and the remainder is 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86368513

5d635fbf-dd3f-4056-9dc1-f9ac25a68c10
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:56.216
So we put the remainder here and
then the quotient goes as they

b218c18f-09e2-4119-a2dd-79e3c951afaf
01:01:56.216 --> 01:01:57.926
carry to the next position.

81041bea-8962-400a-a175-efbf2cd4091a
01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:05.292
And then one plus one 2 + 0
becomes two again, 2 cannot be

d6fbf0e7-c104-4f01-bd11-c4e7b4606b80
01:02:05.292 --> 01:02:10.428
represented here. You have to
break it into based on the base

0b2db94c-c8fb-4702-9090-d69be611f0d1
01:02:10.428 --> 01:02:15.564
two, so divided by two becomes
one remainder is 0, so again

a45f03c5-4968-47f4-b9b7-03c5d2e92898
01:02:15.564 --> 01:02:17.704
remainder and Carrie goes here.

c4dc0168-67fb-4e44-b23d-492eb4776969
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:24.298
Again, 1 + 1 two plus 0= 2,2 is
equal to zero with a carry.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83997405

9eb8c44f-ca99-47af-9525-7d53ee574e71
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:33.150
1 + 1 two plus
0=2 So 2 is zero with a carry.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8973157

58d19965-a373-49ca-8531-6cab92dee723
01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:41.557
This is the last carry 1 + 0
+ 0 becomes one so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8962182

6da8be84-6986-4d95-a65a-8cb9d6636567
01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:48.084
It becomes a 5 digit
number 10000 and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.8962182

f2948ceb-55d4-4b4f-a7c4-ffe4f6469500
01:02:48.084 --> 01:02:50.428
the next number is.

75afdf1d-0235-4cb6-b97f-a8a28dfc829b
01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:56.994
Because we are looking for the two
digits, the next two digits. So we

25d19914-09fb-4efa-a117-d85617ec59ac
01:02:56.994 --> 01:02:58.799
have to plus this number.

1e0aa251-56f9-4588-8cfc-b508cddbabc3
01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:06.450
With one so now, if we
do this it becomes 01100000101.

780a1dce-68ee-4655-a7de-4b0bdb826914
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:13.380
So these are the last two

41488103-36be-4b34-b644-099798b779fe
01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:21.672

0ed6f529-81d4-46b9-a9b2-1dfdfde06156
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.792
Be careful we are in the radix

NOTE Confidence: 0.88796127

01751524-98cb-45ea-8ef0-c338bed32084
01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.270
Two is a valid digit.

47ca452c-afb0-4871-a2ae-219ddec97bd1
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:12.380
So this time we have.

01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:15.860
Let's back to the question.

5e2eb138-9e67-46b9-b188-aff089db35d0
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:25.439
We have 1111, but this number
is in the base 3.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90787

39f48ed6-aa20-4964-be39-f48a2e6a5e16
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:29.560
So the next number is +1.

824f7646-49a1-4681-8019-d4c1309fa5e2
01:04:31.090 --> 01:04:36.835
So 1 1 becomes 2, but we can use
the digit 2 because we are in

df720525-35bf-4b67-a78e-6128373b9119
01:04:36.835 --> 01:04:39.516
Radix 3. So we put two here.

4d0e88aa-3db8-41cf-a89c-2ef00e115019
01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:44.240

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.178
next number. And then next
number after this again we

8dd5637f-6927-4e9c-9b64-37c3e092ea4d
01:04:49.178 --> 01:04:52.157

01:04:54.390 --> 01:05:00.518
2 + 1 becomes 3. Now it's not
a valid number, so we have to 3

efd2aac1-fcf3-4092-9f06-fe0c649accb9
01:05:00.518 --> 01:05:06.263

And then 10 no carry to the

e34ec6da-9288-42dd-b0c8-53a253df4f50
01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:31.236
Divided by 4 because we are in
base-4, each subsection is

01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:43.698
1 / 4 is equal to 1 unit.

01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:49.350
So then we can represent the

say that the distance is.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:15:00.619
123410 is equal to four in base

b0ea3a91-729b-4ae6-a098-adc716ffc377
01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:15.640
If we need more precision.

4c12e49b-83a6-480a-beeb-1b2776628be4
01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:21.873
We can split that, I mean a

c891fa33-c2a6-473a-8c5b-3b306bfb7ca1
01:15:21.873 --> 01:15:27.216
or that 1 / 4 divided by another
four subsections. So we can

d1966ca8-6525-4546-8379-8dd720addd7f
01:15:27.216 --> 01:15:33.792
simply do this so this time it
becomes 1 / 4 / 4 which is equal

a0b5b1e9-debc-4d1e-a98a-149334aecdb1
01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:45.545
So if you start with the

01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:51.630
One section over 8 subsections,
so it becomes 01 or this is

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:57.090

d5a20eda-dde0-43af-844c-c4afd3b687c6

01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:19.760
So now we can represent the

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:25.178

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:37.926
So if we need more precision, we
have to break it more, so we

So imagine we have this here.

393ff242-e18d-4866-81a5-0ddbd28a4215
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:59.415

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.808

The same we just multiply each

decompose this number.

01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:49.208
integral part. So for the zero
and the next step you have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.87300456

5109feba-2ca2-4648-aae8-cfb73e6e5323
01:20:49.208 --> 01:20:53.088
increment this by a unit of

01:20:53.088 --> 01:20:56.968
next is this which is equal to
zero point 125.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9056802

32a3e6eb-ec01-4add-aa05-21440c4e35a1
01:20:57.710 --> 01:21:02.630
And then the next is this 1 *
2 to the power of minus two

NOTE Confidence: 0.9056802

4a667c5d-9aef-4d61-90a6-43243de5d3d9
01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:03.942
plus all the zeros.

f7cda173-7020-4934-95a5-796cdc0cc24e
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:10.355
So you can see that as from zero
it goes to zero point 125 and

868aa8d0-4155-471a-b5eb-0c90ee5a154f
01:21:10.355 --> 01:21:12.485
then it goes to 0.25 etc.

01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:16.552
And when you are done with the
old available numbers in the

01:21:18.298 --> 01:21:24.354
one. So from zero to one you
can have these numbers this

01:21:24.354 --> 01:21:29.704
fractional numbers. So these are
the fractional normal in base-2.

b422ea70-6dc3-4eb7-8dfa-c9139164bcd5
01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:35.568
OK, so then we have to sum it.

The Slash Plus B is means that
63 + 1 becomes 64.

01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:50.378
But we are not allowed to
represent 64, so we have

01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:05.048

4efd5ecd-f7dc-4c7c-b9c7-14fa6ccc3a67
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:09.198

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:21.186
And then they put a carry to the
next position. So this Carry is

01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:45.996
And B is 1, so 1 + 25
becomes 26 + 0 becomes 26.
