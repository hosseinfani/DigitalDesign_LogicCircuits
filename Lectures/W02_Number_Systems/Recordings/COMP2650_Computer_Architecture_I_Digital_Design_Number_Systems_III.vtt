that the 10% is huge amount of
bonus point, so I wanted to

2fdf1a6e-1ee5-465d-8b62-347978f47782
00:07:08.173 --> 00:07:12.985
reduce it to 5% and still
there's a bonus point there. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.86478835

72489d48-96fc-456c-9c6d-8fe873ded23c
00:07:12.985 --> 00:07:18.198

335e02a9-cc5d-4f86-81c5-2f70f6acc1e9
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.998
Cool, let's start.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8330938

1a3ac67f-c04f-4208-ba06-3e4adee8a2d0
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:33.884
Uh, last session we end up with
a fraction how to add fraction

NOTE Confidence: 0.8330938

702f369c-69e4-4dcb-8b60-6d4b692b03d7
00:08:33.884 --> 00:08:36.274
numbers in a numbering system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87914586

c9c74db3-96da-4f5e-9598-3f3280671475
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:43.425
So we just I just wanted to do a
very quick recap on the fraction

NOTE Confidence: 0.87914586

7ae12318-0f4c-4720-9d6d-e2e088d49af2
00:08:43.425 --> 00:08:48.669
concept or topic as we said, in
order to have a fraction.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85792947

dc3b4b9f-ee42-4aea-b2c9-a209e6d96684
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:55.046
Uh, we just have to divide 1
unit by subunits. So if you are

NOTE Confidence: 0.85792947

61dc1974-a4e9-4766-893d-c2e474810b55
00:08:55.046 --> 00:09:01.148
in base four, we divide 1 unit
by 4 so it becomes 1 / 4 or 4 to

NOTE Confidence: 0.85792947

6dc0e6f3-59e6-4dd6-bdf8-ce720573f09a
00:09:01.148 --> 00:09:05.555
the power of minus one. And if
you wanted to pick just one

NOTE Confidence: 0.85792947

316a0a2a-6416-44c0-9d34-2de4a38a7e73
00:09:05.555 --> 00:09:09.623
section, it becomes 01 in base
four and that one has the

NOTE Confidence: 0.85792947

f8f3e675-2d68-410f-a361-aaa289ade5fa
00:09:09.623 --> 00:09:14.030
significance of four to the
power of minus one or 1 / 4.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85038674

579bda35-874f-4c80-ab80-0814ee02727a
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.864
And we put that in dot as a
fraction point, so anything on

NOTE Confidence: 0.85038674

7f6c0c76-06ef-41b9-adaa-a74b58d2bb65
00:09:18.864 --> 00:09:22.252
the right side is the fraction.
Part, left side is the integer

NOTE Confidence: 0.8586158

ab81abcc-8759-4df7-8c03-490c93a0fc77
00:09:22.252 --> 00:09:28.172
part. If we need two, we said
that two part from the 1 / 4

NOTE Confidence: 0.8586158

7cf12a68-0e49-4ade-8d27-6991562f61a0
00:09:28.172 --> 00:09:31.214
sections subsections, so it
becomes .2 in base 4.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83099854

43d46b3b-af4d-43b0-858e-1422e47b82f8
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.700
33.3 so three subsections of
each one has the significance of

NOTE Confidence: 0.83099854

04858b46-426e-459f-81fb-689e0650fb5e
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:42.580
four to the power of minus one.
And then when we have whole unit

NOTE Confidence: 0.83099854

d89f25a8-68b3-49c9-8da7-3da14f262162
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.200
or four subunits, so it becomes
one to the integer part.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8720051

9edd9b2b-5857-4d72-8d18-fdf587eb6905
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:54.180
So in order to find the distance
of moon to this sun based on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8720051

5345175f-553c-4a51-bf7a-2fe0f0e900e0
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:59.640
fraction, we have 4123 and four
in base four is 1 zero and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.75599337

12114c17-d1a2-4a45-abf5-4327def502ed
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.378
two. Subunits of 1 / 4 so it
becomes 10.2 in the base 4.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8925084

707edd3a-8479-4ba4-9f31-21f4917eb98a
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.218
Again, you said that we can have

NOTE Confidence: 0.84818125

03e96963-4509-4018-9869-48599dc41555
00:10:09.218 --> 00:10:14.285
more precision. Uh, by dividing
the subunits into sub sub units,

NOTE Confidence: 0.84818125

49cfc024-b703-454e-aa68-ae0d26e5cea2
00:10:14.285 --> 00:10:20.095
so 1 / 4 divided by another 4
section becomes in the last

NOTE Confidence: 0.84818125

ba0f52e6-01bf-46e9-8af1-72f0e9b84519
00:10:20.095 --> 00:10:26.735
lecture we we made, I made a
mistake. So 1 / 4 / 4 becomes 2

NOTE Confidence: 0.84818125

d34f2629-7b08-49a5-a613-8a69b5924efd
00:10:26.735 --> 00:10:31.715
to the four to the power minus
two or 1 / 16.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88203186

a5d3d37c-d2b9-4ff4-9b15-10a62d0fa58a
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.726
So this is a little bit any more
precise sub sub section.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8744268

717ae04c-b923-4b3f-8fa7-4f6c1bdc2bd0
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.970
So if we need 1 section
it becoms this .01.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89135796

bc055f8b-c28c-42e3-9083-a7210474a0a1
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:50.910
.02 to 2 subsection so that two has
the significance of four to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.89135796

0bb422e7-9d57-46ff-b22a-1cbb7897558d
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.930
power of minus 2.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8393475

bce43fd5-d7fe-4818-9400-953799c35205
00:10:54.390 --> 00:11:00.130
And then three and four when we
have 4 sub sub section in this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8393475

3bcc25aa-6523-4403-9dd9-c7bfbc3a5ec5
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:05.460
one subsection or 4 * 4 to the
power of minus two, which

NOTE Confidence: 0.8393475

e00086d0-b18b-4dd6-8337-60e7303ebd6e
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.380
becomes 4 to the power minus
one. So .1 in base 4.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8715021

61928397-c8cf-4b5e-b54c-f910f95e1430
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:16.978
So then we have a more precise
distance. Now we have 4.2

NOTE Confidence: 0.8715021

ad613ad8-1913-41e9-8997-3848755c97e5
00:11:16.978 --> 00:11:22.126
subsection and one sub sub
section. So this is the I mean

NOTE Confidence: 0.8715021

da40d042-103a-45d1-bd7c-2509369a1536
00:11:22.126 --> 00:11:26.845
through distance based on this
picture from moon to the sun.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86401296

80125b1f-c04e-46d8-9541-b7aba8036963
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:32.008
Again, if you want to, if you
need more precision, we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.86401296

7c8e7247-e60f-4c09-914f-f518b1524e37
00:11:32.008 --> 00:11:36.675
divide that. I mean 4 to the
power of minus 2 by another

NOTE Confidence: 0.86401296

5d97199f-3007-4a04-927f-ed6a4a785cf1
00:11:36.675 --> 00:11:42.060
four, it becomes 4 to the power
of minus three, so or 1 / 64

NOTE Confidence: 0.9170557

3df20ae9-1d37-4911-91e7-9bc131dbfd45
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.810
subsections. So it gives
more precision.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87771326

6887c6da-e8a2-4bba-9f98-26be2ce31864
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.274
So imagine we are given this
number. We put the fraction

NOTE Confidence: 0.87771326

5e334d6d-1e2f-4e93-a506-89258b485d38
00:11:50.274 --> 00:11:54.162
point, hear anything on the left
is the integer part on the

225b2335-d9eb-49a9-a658-648aef885d0f
00:11:54.162 --> 00:11:55.782
right? Is the fraction part

3da16858-5519-4942-8a95-2617e8d4dd24
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:01.420
If you are in the base four, so
based on the base for the left

NOTE Confidence: 0.8825722

1733cc27-899a-44fa-9881-2e0c14881b26
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.050
side is the significance of the
position or based on the

0ab93b19-f93a-4e9d-ac43-6c05974f298c
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.680
increasing powers of four
positive from zero to 7 to 8

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676626

f64dceec-e907-4f5f-8af7-1a4c41438ddc
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.745
positions of integer. And to the
right the fraction part,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676626

1056be36-faff-4012-8347-b65ec5456f19
00:12:13.745 --> 00:12:17.305
significance, significance of
the position are decreasing from

3f5cc5c7-c68f-42ed-8d47-382cd60c3db6
00:12:17.305 --> 00:12:23.090
minus one to minus 5 five positions
of fraction and then in order to

a2c5722b-3faa-40d2-8764-20cbc20ecb52
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:27.540
see what's this number in
decimal system or what's the

af0904f7-aafc-4306-91b4-8bce71d2b552
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.655
value of this number in base 10.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8816881

eacb1a28-4b53-4425-829e-a028e280b7ad
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:37.113
We have to do very similar at
with it. So basically just do

NOTE Confidence: 0.8816881

33fb5b31-2860-42e6-b905-b40b84d36b30
00:12:37.113 --> 00:12:41.323
the sum multiplication of each
digit to the significance of

0c89985b-1ae3-422c-98eb-c7440fcc8b61
00:12:41.323 --> 00:12:43.428
each position and then some

49a34b27-9b34-4a5f-a6a2-5e34a596d49e
00:12:43.428 --> 00:12:47.762
together. For the fraction part,
the same digits, each digit

NOTE Confidence: 0.8712229

fc953191-116c-417f-9ac7-14c7d728fb7e
00:12:47.762 --> 00:12:51.242
multiplied by the significance
of the position, and then all

b371d96d-f8ca-4d22-916c-2181a169ed0c
00:12:51.242 --> 00:12:55.641
sum together. So usually when
we are given the I mean

NOTE Confidence: 0.8512776

681cbc0f-6eef-4c6c-adb6-771578422739
00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:58.602
fraction number with a

97c33bef-12b7-419e-8bad-541a6c1aa048
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:04.010
We do the integer about
first and then the fraction

So the solution is more

00:20:17.875 --> 00:20:22.198
can we extend the fraction part

But another solution is this.

another solution is finding the

00:20:44.395 --> 00:20:48.652

we said that we can roughly

00:21:02.858 --> 00:21:06.994
within this system we have to
represent 1.02. So let's find

00:21:06.994 --> 00:21:10.754

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:17.936
So the two most similar number,

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:13.070
How can we know that this number

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:23.804
They think this is the number in
the binary, so 11. This is the

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:37.891
Here you can you have to simply
multiply each digit based on the

ad63b4be-263e-4a46-bfbe-638bad8c298b
00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:44.896
powers of two, so 1 * 2 to
the power of their. We have four

c7348ac8-771e-4b4c-ba99-a74e518bfa2b
00:28:44.896 --> 00:28:51.901
positions, so it becomes 4 - 1
becomes 3 plus up until 1 * 2

NOTE Confidence: 0.8750181

5dd1b695-6fe5-4edc-82dd-b68a87b15766
00:28:51.901 --> 00:28:55.637

ff39a320-4abc-4249-afb4-364f65d2398f
00:28:55.637 --> 00:29:01.733
so. The same as you did here. So
for this one, for instance this

7cfd5a81-4fa8-4841-b31f-6d04f0909314
00:29:01.733 --> 00:29:07.298
one, this one is equal to 0 * 2
to the power of 3 zero

NOTE Confidence: 0.8867971

e8723209-130f-4ba3-93f6-5b10c26a8623
00:29:07.298 --> 00:29:11.008
multiplied to the power up until
here, because zero is

3afae971-0053-4ae8-89a3-d9e3716f7d91
00:29:11.008 --> 00:29:16.573
multiplied, so the result is 0
and then here 1 * 2 to the power

a8ead2bf-0c35-4b33-abd3-01d9d4cfe376
00:29:16.573 --> 00:29:17.686

1 to 5 * 2 to the power of

00:29:22.571 --> 00:29:28.400
minus 2 ,0. And this is the
result. So the same way we

f03dfd46-836c-41cc-8f39-a9ba454a6207
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.840
can convert this number to

00:30:16.326 --> 00:30:22.904
number in any numbering system.
Is it possible to transform it

00:30:22.904 --> 00:30:25.296
to another numbering system?

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.166
We already saw number from
base R. We want to convert

afe01018-ecac-4422-95e1-37e53d992daa
00:30:31.166 --> 00:30:34.148
it to another numbering

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:41.334
So we already saw how we can do
the transformation from any

NOTE Confidence: 0.87894076

1c41757f-ce73-41b6-a483-837f7dda2016
00:30:41.334 --> 00:30:45.646
numbering system based on base
R to, decimal system or base 10.

00:30:45.646 --> 00:30:49.566
So basically based on that math
formulation, you just simply

NOTE Confidence: 0.87894076

0e2afa13-a7c8-4d7b-bb7b-e105ca9e1943
00:30:49.566 --> 00:30:53.878
have to multiply each digit to
the significance of the position

c56207f2-0bea-4fed-9bdc-31dd8910b4ba
00:30:53.878 --> 00:30:58.974
based on the powers of R and
then some together. So you do

65e59452-cc57-4197-b651-95c3214c645f
00:30:58.974 --> 00:31:03.678
this for integer part. You do
that for you do the same

00:31:03.678 --> 00:31:06.422
calculation for the fraction

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.464
And with the number in decimal

ff9d99e8-8644-44a4-9350-27403c54267f
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:17.900
other numbering system to

bd9ed90a-25b5-4400-bffe-4f887fa6e334
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.650
so? This is the formulation.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.620

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.890
But how about the reverse?
If you're giving a number

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.884
So in order to figure out an

c2aef9fc-67a6-4bec-aeb6-2ebcb3b44813
00:31:36.884 --> 00:31:41.489

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.633
gives. It gives an idea that how
can we convert from any decimal

1a856bd4-0f5a-42e5-88fa-d734e88767bd
00:31:50.633 --> 00:31:54.062
number to any other numbering

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:59.750
So let's. Having this number,
let's assume we have this number

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.324
So in order to generate a number
in any numbering system, we have

NOTE Confidence: 0.9096765

ac545364-3ba9-44d0-bb59-b9b641a12092
00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:07.716
to generate the digits.

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:13.191
So in order to represent this
number in the base 10 itself, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.888562

34448431-dc90-4656-851f-b12e20a5fb8e
00:32:13.191 --> 00:32:17.118
we have to 1st generate the
digit in the first position

NOTE Confidence: 0.888562

6b0a22c0-7744-47ef-a808-6d751cd81b1d
00:32:17.118 --> 00:32:21.045
based on the significance of 10
to the power of 0.

c5f4d6a4-ca74-4630-8ac3-c04fb660b94e
00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:26.384
Then the next digit based on
the significance of 10 to the

1ecb8e1b-1a85-412b-8093-9ebe4f8f1984
00:32:26.384 --> 00:32:30.146
power of 1 or the second
position, and then the third

cd954027-8bea-404d-a4a5-bdf310138205
00:32:30.146 --> 00:32:34.250
position. The significance is
10 to the power of two. So if

d361a165-6475-4195-8049-a3f645bed0c2
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:37.670
you aren't generate digits,
we have to find the digits.

So this is equal to do this. So
if I have the first position an

NOTE Confidence: 0.9088746

80c8daef-e150-419e-8a10-40e77ac8ade6
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.956
add, put the first position so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8679002

708987ba-35fe-48cc-9db8-a6c17ededa88
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.891
Then the result is a number
without the first position, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.8679002

0c58dd76-0db1-4e27-8c03-e9480e3efd4e
00:33:14.891 --> 00:33:18.422
three becomes the first position
with the significance of that to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8679002

fc94ee9a-8422-4820-acec-6d52f933c72d
00:33:18.422 --> 00:33:19.706
the power of 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88142025

2c9c38f0-2ff6-4d9a-94ac-df0d277214cf
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.248
And then if I add to three.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8943243

7ad142c7-da44-422c-95c9-4e3b86b9d4d8
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:26.766
So we have this number and now
one becomes the first position.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84224695

f726325b-4a44-418c-8714-da74ca440b4e
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.736
And etc. So by just outputing
the digits from the right side,

NOTE Confidence: 0.84224695

68ef7feb-d455-4b37-a9ae-41f75e662411
00:33:31.736 --> 00:33:36.032
we can assume that each digit
has a significance 10 to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.84224695

539de0fa-63c7-4409-9f7a-25f422226600
00:33:36.032 --> 00:33:37.106
power of 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90631926

be0c845c-b9b2-4944-bef9-b894d0f441cb
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:42.447
So how can we do that? How can
we just extract the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.90631926

80f3210d-71c8-4053-903c-14ac3dc3ab2c
00:33:42.447 --> 00:33:43.992
position from a decimal number?

NOTE Confidence: 0.86941326

d080e4e3-52f6-4758-80fe-b4625638feac
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:49.795
We do this by just dividing by
10 as we did in the high school

NOTE Confidence: 0.86941326

48ef5211-3705-40a1-be22-4d5bead42a2e
00:33:49.795 --> 00:33:52.776
or primary school. So whenever
we wanted to see the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.86941326

1edc82cb-70ea-4302-bd63-2f1f74afcee8
00:33:52.776 --> 00:33:55.757
position, 1st digit of a number,
we just divided by 10.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8774285

5d977024-5079-46ff-80f0-4374c8f07679
00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:01.086
So as you can see here, if I
divide this number by 10, the

NOTE Confidence: 0.91728556

945d46bd-e683-4d28-bb16-e16e6b0cd20b
00:34:01.086 --> 00:34:04.482
quotient. Actually, is this
without the first position

NOTE Confidence: 0.91728556

31107672-183a-4e24-a9ab-d9c856ca221c
00:34:04.482 --> 00:34:06.834
and the remainder is the
first position.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87155956

6fd5a90e-397d-4f40-8e3a-abecbf78ebbf
00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:12.814
So by just one division we can
end up we can have the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.8849936

5e448984-fa5e-43d3-95b7-d51d6da866e8
00:34:12.814 --> 00:34:15.730
position digit. And the
remainders.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8388271

763bb4bc-bda0-4476-a46f-b271ee771447
00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.262
The the other actually digits of

4f06006d-dc35-4531-a511-22a17bcc5d50
00:34:19.262 --> 00:34:22.060
the number. So for the second

be0899fb-83b1-49d1-891b-143097e135fe
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:26.996
one. We can assume that there is
no first position, so we don't

NOTE Confidence: 0.87930906

5a7c6536-da4d-435b-b9e8-404c16ce16bf
00:34:26.996 --> 00:34:31.052
have one anymore. So here is the
number. So the previous quotient

NOTE Confidence: 0.87930906

88037a3e-ca0e-4152-a2ca-dc6152685736
00:34:31.052 --> 00:34:35.108
becomes the new number, and then
we do another division. So by

37b893a1-ba5d-4ff6-8532-58da6df04338
00:34:35.108 --> 00:34:37.812
another division we just, the
remainder is the.

b2e3d8df-de82-4457-88a5-4e05f40815ed
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.090
A digit in the first position.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7640553

6ef1c017-e4e1-46d2-96fc-6abcf267d5e6
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.305
And the quotient becomes the

NOTE Confidence: 0.90021867

9dd9fbe7-dabc-47b2-b184-d7eee15b5823
00:34:44.305 --> 00:34:47.002
remainders. The remaining

c17bc766-fdf7-4ea9-8f25-51511669730f
00:34:47.002 --> 00:34:51.269
digits. So the second division
gives us the 2nd digit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86100763

6950e8c9-b3b6-44dc-8a54-af6ba177598c
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:57.095
The Third Division give us the
third actually digit, but the

f4dff321-1987-4c70-99b2-9bac60d5e50a
00:34:57.095 --> 00:35:01.545
division, the Third Division are
based on the previous quotient.

01534634-8810-4e58-80dd-2546489bbb54
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:09.033
So this is the way. So just by
one division. The remainder is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8522033

2aa6a303-f111-424b-ad66-7f457ea848d7
00:35:09.033 --> 00:35:13.884
the 1st Digit, Second Division
for the new number or the

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:26.100
until. The last digit bill after
that, is when the quotient

be7a9ac7-cba3-4379-9671-ced99304944e
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:33.830

d04defa7-5fba-42ec-b24a-769ebf8d33da
00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:40.900
8. Uh, digits, so we did
eight division to produce the

f9a9ad53-ae19-4f18-bba8-aa4ff789165a
00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:47.621
all 8 digits. But whenever we
want to write this down, we go

2698d65b-06d3-4535-87b1-206fcf3bfdbe
00:35:47.621 --> 00:35:50.206
from the reverse order so.

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:57.370

So this is the way we

801f05f0-02e6-4100-8ea0-b657825886e5
00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:59.680

that how can we produce the

8aa16aeb-ed25-47fc-8565-6feee267638d

d4d6bc78-7472-4eff-bebe-cdc3e39b1616
00:36:17.858 --> 00:36:23.262
we wanted to convert it to base

NOTE Confidence: 0.8833918

b3ae673b-0387-4266-b55e-63015a93a5cb
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:28.514

00:36:30.831 --> 00:36:36.250
1st digit. And then we divide
the quotient as the new number

f5cc4056-38d4-4981-83cb-c7e3841d4f75
00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:39.940
by 16, so the remainder becomes
the 2nd digit.

95cfcaaa-69cd-40df-9ed2-f949cd8c182a
00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.258

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:49.070
The quotient becomes zero. Then
the quotient becomes zero. The

6349d41d-5296-4dbd-9972-6ddafcb3f538
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:57.974
So the number divided by 8 the

bf1dd3e1-40a3-4be3-99d9-38ae0c366113
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.844
And then they put all the digits
in the reverse order, so this

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:20.346
As you can see, when we reduce
the base, we need more positions

21e1e6bd-1f0c-480d-a466-82b6ba5f50f9
00:38:20.346 --> 00:38:25.530

It needs lower positions,

d2935559-0cab-4f70-847b-fb43aa56cebb
00:38:30.282 --> 00:38:35.070
smaller positions. A smaller

f654b465-abcd-4f7f-a65b-232842793994
00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:44.975
So this time, if you are

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:52.010
But this was the integer

b9a6a554-27ec-4109-a002-d7238ddb5ce6
00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:53.610
conversion? How about the

cd2b599e-90b7-48e3-a003-b25de44d8543
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:58.553
fraction? The same procedure
actually we did for the decimal

NOTE Confidence: 0.90627897

70f5262b-159c-4983-802c-760cc5d8d970
00:45:58.553 --> 00:46:01.612
system in order to come up with

NOTE Confidence: 0.9187398

d86a8b8f-1600-4020-9111-b02b6100f90b
00:46:01.612 --> 00:46:06.780
an algorithm. So again, we can
assume that we wanted to convert

NOTE Confidence: 0.9187398

bbd22649-de5c-4ca6-92e4-f2694162a620
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.644
a fraction number in decimal
system to itself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87803537

3b8e482f-471f-497e-920d-fbe54ae81cca
00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.442
Just to see how can
we make an algorithm.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9249657

6b6a8b7d-2591-4ecf-9454-c2c13ccb1074
00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:19.270
So if you are given this number
in decimal system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86016715

8050e12a-a1dc-4c7b-ab16-9b17c89e4770
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:25.084
The first, I mean, a significant
number is this, I mean just the

NOTE Confidence: 0.86016715

cf35d605-8662-42b4-98ee-31cc4b580e63
00:46:25.084 --> 00:46:27.074
number after the fraction point.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86504126

71702eee-e1a3-4b59-a5b9-e416e56ace76
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:30.546
Which has the 10 to the power of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8929231

2b94854c-8183-4916-8f55-a5ee2f7f61a4
00:46:30.546 --> 00:46:36.404
minus one. And the 2nd digit is
6, 10 to the power of minus two

NOTE Confidence: 0.8929231

4f033ed9-914d-4693-ae76-ace160f13525
00:46:36.404 --> 00:46:41.305
and etc. So this time in order
to generate the digit, we have

NOTE Confidence: 0.8929231

a6128330-2a37-44be-8f1c-3072b35a8314
00:46:41.305 --> 00:46:45.829
to extract the digit from the
left side of the fractional part.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9323129

7f168c40-3229-471b-9911-601234994ff6
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.415
So basically we have to do this,

NOTE Confidence: 0.86142015

78c2df3d-16f3-4b10-8ad4-2f86d8df0957
00:46:49.415 --> 00:46:54.252
two. And then we extract
two. We end up with the new

NOTE Confidence: 0.86142015

a839f661-a027-44a9-9da6-2fdff853ea81
00:46:54.252 --> 00:46:56.499
fraction number and
then extract 6.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85107833

f60d8c1e-7073-488b-9239-e516c621e5f5
00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:01.390
And end up with a new fraction
number and, etc.

NOTE Confidence: 0.91416895

a18a01cb-c0bc-4fc7-af91-cbed363ca055
00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:06.122
So this is the way we generate
the digits of a fraction number

NOTE Confidence: 0.8959383

31c2cf9d-6db1-4803-b958-14378e1717d6
00:47:06.122 --> 00:47:12.780
in decimal system. So how can we
extract the digits of the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.8959383

6992d5e2-fca4-4116-b9bd-0e340ad5fa9f
00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.343
digit of a fraction part?

NOTE Confidence: 0.80011445

7cb4ad00-f9be-48eb-985b-6d04f59d06a8
00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:21.022
By just multiplying as we did in
the high school. So a

NOTE Confidence: 0.80011445

6d02875b-0afc-4acd-9d70-4c777a69f4f3
00:47:21.022 --> 00:47:25.796
fraction number multiplied by 10
extract makes the 1st digit to

NOTE Confidence: 0.80011445

7211f912-fd02-47f2-a686-0e6fdb053cef
00:47:25.796 --> 00:47:27.098
the integer part.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9441916

98b29fb2-b554-4bfb-8bd1-d5ae3965b9c4
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:28.490
So.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8659826

36b67267-0d95-41e5-af8e-5e508b9ba6ca
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:35.366
By just one multiplication we
can have the 1st digit in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9274675

8a37ae11-e25d-48a2-8d03-f34535d14120
00:47:35.366 --> 00:47:39.882
fraction part. And then if you
continue the multiplication by

NOTE Confidence: 0.85159093

d78d30e2-d7de-49d1-bb3f-dc5933f01ada
00:47:39.882 --> 00:47:44.634
the remainder. So we assume
that there is no other

NOTE Confidence: 0.85159093

bea06c8a-6fb2-41f1-b71e-89bc134230c1
00:47:44.634 --> 00:47:47.665
2 or we start
multiplying by the

NOTE Confidence: 0.85159093

3e679361-190d-467a-94f6-7c4dca71abb5
00:47:47.665 --> 00:47:50.696
remaining fraction part. So
the next digit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8723412

e2724367-ed36-4134-8e1b-35af85cfd7c7
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.980
So basically this time instead
of just dividing by 10, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8723412

6b0af93f-1252-4e43-9856-5fb2f5c96c31
00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:02.020
multiply by 10, so we multiply
the fraction part by 10, keep

NOTE Confidence: 0.8723412

76655d0f-b5f0-4f8c-bc46-2bf5e1711eb9
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:05.800
the integer part and then
continue multiplication by 10

NOTE Confidence: 0.8723412

5b911b72-cd2c-4e5c-8fd4-1e87d7ecfb1f
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.900
for the remainder fraction part.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8712591

11eef586-6da0-4c26-a012-b0c512cb626d
00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:14.694
So as you can see, the first
fraction part is 2 and then you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8712591

3443685f-0757-42bf-9c92-308869b36522
00:48:14.694 --> 00:48:19.435
continue multiplied by 10 for
the remaining 6501. So 10

NOTE Confidence: 0.8712591

da4a3312-9519-4560-8d85-b92b127d2015
00:48:19.435 --> 00:48:24.176
extracts 6, and then we continue
with the multiplication with the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8712591

1e56d279-c198-4714-bda5-a27c1597add3
00:48:24.176 --> 00:48:26.762
remainder integer part. 5, 0, 1

NOTE Confidence: 0.8696376

72847ebf-646c-4674-b0e8-e23fc6023209
00:48:26.762 --> 00:48:32.208
/ 10. But another difference is
that you have to put the integer

NOTE Confidence: 0.8696376

4b878b82-f97b-4f63-9273-8b26f9e192cc
00:48:32.208 --> 00:48:36.144
part in the right order because
you are generating from the left

NOTE Confidence: 0.8696376

4544326a-d26e-4807-a58d-044b51147236
00:48:36.144 --> 00:48:40.408
to right, so you put it the
integer part in the right order.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88893825

0ef95380-1ae2-40ee-a563-fbcb4e5d9f10
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:44.722
So you multiply by 10
and put the integer part in

NOTE Confidence: 0.88893825

ba02a698-ae6f-4949-82c3-a4688eebc6a7
00:48:44.722 --> 00:48:45.598
the right order.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74469805

83183e53-b318-4d2f-b6bc-124a1d0acabb
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:51.426
So now the same algorithm
for converting

NOTE Confidence: 0.74469805

7d4bac6b-508e-4e40-94fa-03b3fac3a6d4
00:48:51.426 --> 00:48:55.058
decimal fraction number to
base-16 fraction number.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8800853

3276a23b-ba5e-40d5-9003-b3b0ebcd0c84
00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:00.329
So this was the decimal
number multiplied by 16

NOTE Confidence: 0.8800853

633e1c66-fd15-45c5-b544-b774fa7244e4
00:49:00.329 --> 00:49:04.539
results in this. We keep the
integer part four. We

NOTE Confidence: 0.8800853

44c308ef-e31e-4f93-b4fb-26720ded9eea
00:49:04.539 --> 00:49:07.486
continue the multiplication
with the remainder fraction

NOTE Confidence: 0.8800853

5682ab0a-c298-47f9-9b42-6c7c029dea0a
00:49:07.486 --> 00:49:07.907
part.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9134604

9d2a83a1-17fb-4fcf-a550-4c04c189a92d
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:14.615
So as you can see the results for
3, 13, seven etc.

NOTE Confidence: 0.847043

f4f2c5fa-5392-41a0-b7b6-e7006ebb1315
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:20.349
And we know that 13 is equal to
D. 11 is equal to be B, etc. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.847043

532526fa-078e-4401-8ece-66f03f2cbc46
00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:22.725
but then we put it digits in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.87873733

ecbbea50-7332-4d81-9608-750c7a480eca
00:49:22.725 --> 00:49:28.139
right order. So this number
becomes this number in base-16.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82109404

bb669d13-502b-4ec4-aca3-5f773559ec61
00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:36.164
So for the converting any
fraction number or decimal fraction

NOTE Confidence: 0.82109404

6447a857-39ed-4589-a49a-ae911d1e8240
00:49:36.164 --> 00:49:38.148
number to base-8,

814fdb42-9928-45dd-ac5c-62f3687172b9
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:43.024
base-2 or any other
basis. For instance 7, 3,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8880756

52602dde-6626-4440-aaeb-2bcd9b10c5dd
00:49:43.024 --> 00:49:47.248
or etc. You can apply the
same algorithm. So again I

ceb76111-df71-4073-8120-962fb92c0bbf
00:49:47.248 --> 00:49:51.120
wanted to show you how can we

037c4fbc-9c16-4bac-a11a-36d4b5c98f5b
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:58.600
So let's.

Just get rid of this.

2e3c2e58-0507-4454-a91a-7e543614ebfe
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:15.110
So imagine now we wanted to.

93dfb817-c745-482e-af1d-5e09df4e4761
00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:21.494
Convert base number, a

dec66f6f-370d-4d2d-bbea-eba849b88386
00:50:36.622 --> 00:50:40.834
integer part. So for instance,
if I wanted to convert 0.4

NOTE Confidence: 0.6430525

2f2e1088-e17b-4178-93f0-74df41743256

to base, for instance,

4fc8e705-d333-49d5-95d4-428b9b99650e
00:50:45.071 --> 00:50:50.840
3. The result should be the

NOTE Confidence: 0.86135966

7986a2a0-f045-4806-9161-7536158f5f96
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.450
to put this cell, this number

NOTE Confidence: 0.91400325

2378e8aa-551f-4601-970a-f46c7bfe4639
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:57.218
Multiplied by this number. This is

80b6efa7-99f4-4aed-bc07-a0fd6438033e
00:50:57.218 --> 00:51:02.963
the result. And the integer

0609c3e8-0962-4ba8-8ad9-91fb4bcd962e
00:51:02.963 --> 00:51:07.682
0. So in order to keep the
integer part, I could say that.

And here is the integer part.

745e373a-e358-4877-b96b-3726b9effc5a
00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:47.920
And then here you have to
continue the multiplication, but

00:52:12.541 --> 00:52:16.533

you continue the multiplication

2a6c18d2-fe18-4f26-b067-0486a7dfac6e
00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:19.028

to repeat this process.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8730588

bc40ecb7-4763-4025-8425-2bba910c1af7
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:40.768
So you can see that I mean, uh,
each time, this time it creates

00:52:40.768 --> 00:52:46.552
zero. This time it creates 0. So
0.204 multiplied by

f221d8dc-0eb2-490e-b44c-ed93ea64d7cf
00:52:46.552 --> 00:52:51.388

digits in the right order, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.7977711

5b879e5a-6bb1-401c-85d7-37d2d75554f8
00:52:51.388 --> 00:52:55.220
the conversion is based on

00:52:55.220 --> 00:53:02.952
the radix number 3, so this is

befd67ef-6e0f-4d0c-bf85-983f0b825bb9
00:53:02.952 --> 00:53:08.412

00:53:36.558 --> 00:53:40.974
same number, so you have to add
more precision in order to

855dfb60-f3f0-4cf3-b837-87049773769b
00:54:00.958 --> 00:54:07.249
all these. Uh, numbers, so
although this is not the exact

So if you are given a number

And then for the integer part,
you do the exact algorithm,

a5003ea3-5552-475d-a404-414133c7dd2a
00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:05.130
division by 10. If you want to

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:08.980
you have to multiply
by powers of 10.

07aa4ef4-502e-406c-babb-95ee774610c4
00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:13.568
And then from 10 to our prime
you have to divide it by our

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:47.206
For instance, if you're given

00:55:56.774 --> 00:56:01.190
so we have to convert the

just divid it by 8.

00:56:05.178 --> 00:56:09.440
the reverse order. For the

e72d2fd9-7f81-4045-952b-1583e6eb9a18
00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:14.055
and then keep the integer part

to base-4, base-8, base-16,
there is no need for you to

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:10.142
OK. So we can continue. Now
we know how to represent

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.674

319f3cb3-fd47-46f6-a43c-52fdc57ce0d5
01:00:22.674 --> 01:00:26.530
division for numbers in

01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:32.314
already knew how to do in
decimal system, but we wanted to

900b8187-c698-4ffb-ab52-bd0a71ebfe7d
01:00:32.314 --> 01:00:36.652
see what's the algorithm in

fae87fbd-0a27-44e6-a477-fd0e6938d0c0
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:38.660
So the first is addition.

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:43.604
Very similar algorithm,
as you saw before. I

01:00:43.604 --> 01:00:47.180
mean, whenever you want to come
up with an algorithm in any

fc7a89a7-b101-404c-996a-7138174d9d6e
01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.160
other numbering system, we use
decimal system as the reference.

ee28e588-4d7a-4105-8f5a-66277b1316bd
01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.736
So whatever we did in the
decimal system, we can use it

79c560bc-15e4-4d0e-9b32-7ef3c7fc88f1
01:00:53.736 --> 01:00:57.014
for any other numbering system.
For conversion, we do the same.

01:00:57.014 --> 01:01:01.484

same so we know how to do the

353add6e-4e85-4af3-8bde-63c727b738b4
01:01:01.484 --> 01:01:04.762
addition in decimal system, so
we can apply the same algorithm

41ff3c88-f1d8-4908-a839-84f6fc7a2a6b
01:01:04.762 --> 01:01:08.338
in other bases. For instance,
here is an example. So if you

16d8948a-31d3-4b89-bf1f-12521124e1b2
01:01:08.338 --> 01:01:10.424
want to convert if you want

NOTE Confidence: 0.8197934

324d9ff6-8633-44e3-a6f9-7de62c0a2dbc
01:01:10.424 --> 01:01:15.720
to do addition on the base-16 or
hexadecimal. Here is an

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.832
example. The first step is if
you are given these two numbers,

29de3c35-5711-4e68-a950-c4190bd6ee77
01:01:20.832 --> 01:01:22.536
fraction with fraction parts.

This is the fraction point.

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:30.210
So the first is you have to pad
the numbers, you have to make the

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.875
You can add zeros to the left of
the integer part because it

2864e2ff-c3dd-4e5c-9c15-cd20bbdadcac

You can add 0 to the right side

again, adding a zero in the

b44d98ac-03ce-4caa-b1cc-e59db72298b7
01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.024
When you do the padding, you
have the same size of numbers.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8792785

aa4d9613-5235-408b-a785-41b23dba6aa6
01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.207
And then you start
adition. So 4 + 0 is 4.

f09bd58d-73d8-4322-8a6c-896159404b8a
01:01:57.990 --> 01:02:03.478
5 + B, which is equal to 11, becomes

01:02:03.478 --> 01:02:09.750
base-16, so you have to divide
it by the base-16 so it ends up

NOTE Confidence: 0.8688601

0456e14e-e9da-48fc-85e6-3b52afbc674e
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:14.454
with one and the remainder is
zero. You put the remainder and

6c205ad2-abe2-4b1c-a1f9-fc0f5bb30bb9
01:02:14.454 --> 01:02:18.766
then put the quotient as they
carry to the next position.

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:25.980
1 + E + 2 becomes 17. 17, again,
you have to break it into base

7c79d1f9-68b0-4910-992c-7b9f706490aa
01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:31.674
of 16 so it becomes. The
remainder is 1 and the carry is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8724548

7127b5d5-aabe-440a-9dc4-77aa3897c62d
01:02:31.674 --> 01:02:36.054
1, so it becomes one and the
carry goes here.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:47.763
An 26 / 16 is 1 and the
remainder is10. So you keep that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8341561

1becb933-0cec-4c20-ac67-b1a240499d49
01:02:47.763 --> 01:02:51.372
remainder and then put the

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:57.660
But you know that 10 is equal to
A and then you continue this

f57bcea3-9502-4ffb-af5a-f6dc356a8f25
01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:03.585

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:25.640
Multiplication is, as you know,

b653aee9-5d94-46ca-a08d-4ffc21553a9e

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:47.020
we can ask you to do

bf830a19-607d-4de6-9be2-e27505ea835f

01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:58.725
Again very similar to
decimal system. So basically the

3529c58e-c95c-4cc7-af5f-97c7615fc87b
01:03:58.725 --> 01:04:03.840
first step is just doing the

a2beb8be-f037-46a1-a0ec-7e148d4bcaa3
01:04:21.002 --> 01:04:26.382
significant position. So we
borrow from E 1 unit. When we

585c4214-e9ac-42ed-8a44-f4b18ed86165
01:04:26.382 --> 01:04:31.762
borrow one year from the higher,

dba59ee6-8dfa-4b74-a0a2-2d2c5163bfb9
01:04:31.762 --> 01:04:34.452
we add based on the

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:40.221

01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:47.874
And then we can do the negation
subtraction. So 16 + 5

3a282ae0-bdb8-4f57-bbf0-34e30df56c5c
01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.732

so -1 + E - 2.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85935676

2359bf9c-20e5-456d-ac3b-88afe3a8f2ed
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:09.856
So it becomes 11, eleven is equal
to B, so 14 - 1, because we

NOTE Confidence: 0.85935676

ffb23e6a-0e0d-4e31-b9ae-206542faea7f
01:05:09.856 --> 01:05:14.246
already borrowed from this, is 13. 13
- 2 becomes 11.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8639087

2fcb61fb-06bd-416f-b3d4-4bdc7db917d4
01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:17.186
11 is called B in base

NOTE Confidence: 0.87666065

aaf3e931-3baf-4595-96de-4f49f7da9ffd
01:05:17.186 --> 01:05:23.736
16. So again, A - F is equal
to. We cannot do that. We need

NOTE Confidence: 0.87666065

d42cb845-f57f-4589-9b22-65fe7bb72320
01:05:23.736 --> 01:05:28.284
to borrow, so we borrowed 16 +
10 - 15 becomes 11.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8751241

06a2dcbc-ee50-49fe-92d7-fdeabf3eccc1
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:35.272
Now we have to subtract 11 from
2 or B from two. It's not

NOTE Confidence: 0.8751241

56d59deb-ce31-46f1-9456-3b1e24684001
01:05:35.272 --> 01:05:39.202
possible, you already borrowed
from this position, so we need

NOTE Confidence: 0.8205522

e0c4d665-2d54-474a-942b-cececdf0c577
01:05:39.202 --> 01:05:41.790
another borrow. So 16

NOTE Confidence: 0.8646433

575fe504-b5a6-485e-8f3a-195dea122206
01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:47.367
+ 2 - 1, we already
borrowed from that, minus 11,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8646433

30143462-867b-4689-a244-5a4256e71c94
01:05:47.367 --> 01:05:48.618
so becomes 6.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85891646

cb07c155-4d27-4613-a3d3-1281f85a06c0
01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:52.550
And then. Minus one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.910589

aff0878e-3264-465e-b2ea-c0e608aaf1a1
01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:57.828
+ 0 - 4, we cannot do that.
We need another borrow.

NOTE Confidence: 0.91597736

e0d22c28-abdd-44f8-967d-db370242575f
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:04.762
So 16 - 1 is 15 plus zero.
15 - 4 = 11.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8442754

afd32c38-8b08-467c-8f98-1058a3312521
01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:11.872
But we need the last borrow, 
we know in the decimal system

NOTE Confidence: 0.8442754

eeb1a286-591e-4b60-9cb9-1ca5a0d63489
01:06:11.872 --> 01:06:16.960
when we have a last borrow, it
means that the result is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8442754

37ad461d-1271-4f89-8110-d04025276753
01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.624
negative. The result? I mean,
the first number is smaller than

NOTE Confidence: 0.8442754

2200e97d-8748-4534-ac16-112f7a6b91a1
01:06:21.624 --> 01:06:26.712
the second number. So when we
have this situation, we have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8442754

175331e4-bf7e-4378-bf97-8feed011c6cc
01:06:26.712 --> 01:06:31.800
apply that last borrow.
So in order to apply that last

NOTE Confidence: 0.8442754

06b1963d-4561-49f0-8049-5bb9c69d0ea9
01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:36.464
borrow, you have to subtract the
result from the borrow we

faebffd8-c75c-44c1-8fd6-8f46c9aef6ed
01:06:36.464 --> 01:06:40.626
already borrowed from. Because we
assume that there is such a

fa011d22-61e5-4482-951b-8bbaa1e13ae6
01:06:40.626 --> 01:06:42.498
number. So when we do this

NOTE Confidence: 0.79345936

701dea01-62b7-4e0d-a604-9ddb92a8f3ef
01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:49.680
subtraction. So 0 from
4 needs a borrow. 16 +

NOTE Confidence: 0.79345936

c2d4f744-26ef-42b0-a6ab-621f7c034fb6
01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.180
0 - 4 = 12 and etc.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9301545

6b3d889e-c3be-491c-b27f-bb66b714e740
01:06:54.820 --> 01:07:01.024
So you can see that the result
is 494.45C.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8298892

4096a238-6625-4ed5-9f2b-d512d84e4bb8
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:05.960
But the result is negative
because we already had last

NOTE Confidence: 0.8298892

597bb37d-2a06-4363-944d-29c2efd3f68f
01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:10.591
borrow, so we put this as a
result, minus this number.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8927989

76016cad-310a-4508-b075-732761bb856f
01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.792
So the division is very similar to
subtraction, so again very

NOTE Confidence: 0.8927989

4fc2eeaa-6772-4671-8b42-7ae4fa82b688
01:07:17.792 --> 01:07:21.664
similar to algorithm in decimal
system. So you can follow the

537cf25d-bedf-428d-a934-867d55dc440c
01:07:21.664 --> 01:07:25.888
same algorithm and we are not
going to cover it today, but

2a72aa3f-d85a-4310-b422-483c46ab7175
01:07:25.888 --> 01:07:27.296
practice it at home.

75bac6af-a20e-43d6-a5d6-0ca2ed1fe1aa
01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:36.070
And now, is
there any questions?

NOTE Confidence: 0.86365896

3b2a39b0-a6fe-42bc-a86d-86180de33f4a
01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:44.328
I can see some questions about
subtraction again, so let me

4e1958c6-1acd-4eb9-86fa-a2b7cf08b8d1
01:07:44.328 --> 01:07:46.268
come back to the subtraction.

c2ac4107-e1d8-4d4c-85bc-ae8c0736acf3
01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:58.800
So for this subtraction, let me
share my camera first in order

NOTE Confidence: 0.88283926

40796f5a-89be-455c-ae60-a8cb7e11b6f6
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:02.250
just to review what we've done
in the decimal system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87645614

895649e8-b273-4587-ac38-ac2d9fd3a227
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:13.658
So in decimal system,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8574483

41b848a4-c106-4d39-961c-fbc790bb4784
01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:18.102
for instance, we want to subtract

NOTE Confidence: 0.83255434

8c1073a4-f7cc-4c92-9366-e1d31462a431
01:08:18.102 --> 01:08:21.208
5 from for instance 9.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8507052

66fb85a8-d1fa-42e6-b7ab-a82ca6eae38a
01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:29.730
The thing is, we can not
subtract 9 from 5, so we need to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8507052

9c081503-2cfe-4edc-9dd9-616a8afa4830
01:08:29.730 --> 01:08:33.330
borrow, so we assume that there
is a number.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8846965

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.868
10 or 10

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:42.120
In decimal system that we can
borrow from, so then we borrowed

NOTE Confidence: 0.88637775

c4d46e7d-c2ab-42b0-b8ca-453566e9edab
01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:46.240
this one. It comes here so when
it comes here because it's

a64df97e-2e0e-46ed-a01b-f74a66db2887
01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.940
in a higher position, it
goes here as 10.

08669002-1a8f-4054-9ddf-256739987935
01:08:50.830 --> 01:08:53.890
So here it becomes +10.

04c74c4f-a948-4c73-b0f2-cc7254577383
01:08:55.430 --> 01:09:01.454
And then +10 + 5
becomes 15. 15 - 9. Now we

41e6293e-40b2-4935-83ac-241486469ca8
01:09:01.454 --> 01:09:05.972
can do the subtraction. 15
- 9 becomes 6.

fc3d6ae7-9967-4c6e-afa5-2450563cab2b
01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:15.035
OK, but do you know that? I
mean, we already know that 5 - 9

738b8586-477f-460e-a1f8-832668839e51
01:09:15.035 --> 01:09:17.140
is equal to -4.

b1a8eff7-3efd-4c72-a12b-b753f0234680
01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:22.022
We already knew that, but assume
that we don't know the result.

ee62fb13-6a4d-45b0-83b3-299300b248b2
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:26.440
So this is the result, but this
is the result

NOTE Confidence: 0.8619497

a2338065-a1cc-4d8b-aa21-41008af034c2
01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:31.342
Without applying the number we
borrowed from so now we have to

34ab79a4-34dc-4f90-a260-a9ee7f182147
01:09:31.342 --> 01:09:34.852
apply that number because we
borrowed from that number. We

53ed6d71-cc96-492f-b601-726a1a23645f
01:09:34.852 --> 01:09:39.064
assume that this number there
that we can borrow from. So now

e546e91c-f76c-4b0a-ab26-b8a7b75eec0f
01:09:39.064 --> 01:09:41.521
if we wanted to apply that

01:09:41.521 --> 01:09:47.936

5e3e4dbe-377c-4ba1-b181-c56a366760e0
01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:54.016
You need to borrow count here, 10
and this becomes -1.

300ec766-b2f1-40ce-9da8-d66db62c7096
01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:57.798
So 10 - 6 becomes 4.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.824
And because we had a last borrow,
oh, we know that this number

NOTE Confidence: 0.8848926

3dc5e506-6cd4-4adc-b9f5-d460fe074d90
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:14.714

01:10:14.714 --> 01:10:17.450
5 - 9, not this one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8501835

b8fff2a1-8fb0-4d03-8f26-c4d10bd9cda6
01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:23.590
Because we needed last
borrow, so we assume that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8501835

a4f468b6-a5af-4c7b-971e-34c715d68937
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:27.190
there is a higher number that
we can borrow from that. Then

NOTE Confidence: 0.8501835

d56e7f81-4b26-48d1-a9f9-a03ed9e59f30
01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:31.090
we end up with the result we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8501835

86ebf375-4771-4e1d-b2f5-3d58e5361d46
01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:32.290
the same principle here.

4bd0d097-0358-4d03-ad76-6b0ad260c6f4
01:10:33.370 --> 01:10:35.908
So when we do the, uh,
let me share my

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:49.140
So when we do the subtraction,
the 1st digit, 4 - 0, is possible,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8834422

ba2a31f3-f252-4f85-9ce3-47466dac6693
01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:50.250
so it becomes 4.

NOTE Confidence: 0.869714

bff72da7-bf21-4111-b0c6-99e63e4d0824
01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:58.542
But here 5 cannot be
subtracted from 11 or B, so we

c2b93ac4-7755-4313-b3ae-1862037b029e
01:10:58.542 --> 01:11:03.118
need to borrow. So we borrow
from the higher position. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.869714

63616632-69b4-405d-8ce7-f7b7f2c75321
01:11:03.118 --> 01:11:08.110
when we borrow 1 unit, we
subtract 1 unit from this

position. And then when it goes
to the disposition at the unit

3a07066d-bd5e-4e83-b7e8-2309a87591ff
01:11:12.684 --> 01:11:17.080

system as the unit of time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8965884

b37917d4-e6bf-4b27-9e68-da212f9bd8a1
01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:20.150
And then this is what we

11e8eb82-e70f-4139-a003-0cd53537efb1
01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:27.162
borrowed. So this 16 + 5 becomes
21. Now we can do the

94619070-d2f2-4968-a84a-10e8d14490b9
01:11:27.162 --> 01:11:30.228
Subtraction. 21 - 11 becomes 10.

Or A, so the same goes
up until here.

df653854-a641-46f0-ba34-188efbc883ce
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:41.350
So again, here -1 we
already borrowed because of

39b5fa44-021c-4634-8dc9-0210ec7c279e
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:46.198
this position. -1 + 0
becomes -1 - 4. We

ad5d20ac-7edd-4490-8079-dcc84cca6316
01:11:46.198 --> 01:11:47.814
cannot do that because

6859ec76-1424-43c4-b0ef-b73ac6c10ed8
01:11:49.190 --> 01:11:52.082

e0e0bf75-aa89-4a5b-9227-adfa74e28016
01:11:52.082 --> 01:11:56.056
another borrow. So this number
with this borrower, we assume

NOTE Confidence: 0.8560186

4ad841ca-7c28-4a99-a61a-8e6be8f48bed
01:11:56.056 --> 01:11:59.488
that there is a higher number
that we can borrow from.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8671939

d218e579-dcaa-43cc-bd2d-6f41526b19b7
01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:03.156
And then we can do
this subtraction, but

NOTE Confidence: 0.8671939

8f0d974e-2211-460e-b5da-affe140b0f25
01:12:03.156 --> 01:12:04.504
we have last borrow.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90567

ddd1d3f2-7f49-4822-8cf2-576dbed5b043
01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:09.902
So by the last four, we know
that the result is negative, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.90567

42fe9dde-5e63-4696-8fde-7df2cf461e8f
01:12:09.902 --> 01:12:14.298
this is not a correct result. So
we have to apply that number we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8957861

36f57f8e-c44d-4c8a-addd-30fee92b8752
01:12:14.298 --> 01:12:19.968
borrowed from. So then we
subtract the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8957861

024be3d5-bf19-45e5-ade3-35dfe245b710
01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:24.056
results of the previous
subtraction from that number

NOTE Confidence: 0.8957861

94853a9f-906f-46cf-8644-2e7cd2c3b1e6
01:12:24.056 --> 01:12:26.100
that we borrowed from.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86899257

cc0d190c-bb22-4164-8b4c-56681337c893
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:33.014
And this is the subtraction. So
0 - 4 is not possible. We need

NOTE Confidence: 0.86899257

4eb9c010-ee65-45b4-a51b-bad8e8c0e2e3
01:12:33.014 --> 01:12:36.262
to borrow 16. 16 + 0 - 4 becomes

NOTE Confidence: 0.840844

006fb878-6b63-407c-b625-ac34cd8b8720
01:12:36.262 --> 01:12:41.870
12. This A cannot be

7c473ab8-b670-4a9a-ac1f-863f3d6e685c
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:46.110
subject from -1,
so we need to borrow. 16

NOTE Confidence: 0.840844

c30f2aef-cbe7-44bf-85b6-a1f69228b086
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:48.654
-1 = 15. 15 - A = 5, and etc.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89856523

86af2632-608f-4dcc-b7d5-54d94271c094
01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:56.894
So this is the ending result,
but we know that this is

NOTE Confidence: 0.89856523

49beece1-46bd-46ab-8523-51c4ea03bf7f
01:12:56.894 --> 01:13:00.766
negative. I mean this is
a positive number,

132d50a6-0a5b-4f44-a3fa-42c0b2c0a938
01:13:00.766 --> 01:13:03.934
but the actual subtraction
going to be negative because

of the last borrow.

01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:12.386
So is there any other questions?

b996a26b-6dc5-4e24-9ba4-cb4c4cf693cd
01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.850

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:27.273
Yes, when you borrow when you're
in the base R, when you borrow

01:13:27.273 --> 01:13:31.365
from the higher position, it
adds R to the lower position.

694f3f7d-6f68-4dbc-a38f-e82df44a47c4
01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:36.480
In decimal when you borrow it adds
plus 10. In base-16, it adds plus

768d0bd1-252f-4d67-882f-1555c6ccc498

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.656
Abdulwahhab says that? I

a324cf34-8819-42e6-9feb-0d425daa6198

four because adding zero to the

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:14.880
So there's another question.
Nolis says that we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.91177505

93c13a5a-e7ca-48c7-8001-1b0f876f8772
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.512
replace five with 10.

b94c8dca-3c55-464f-838e-cd112427817f
01:14:17.210 --> 01:14:19.037
I'm not sure I understand
this question.

bd39161f-4459-4709-8e8f-ad49e9efd6b3
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:25.160
So can you explain it more?

NOTE Confidence: 0.91647625

e2711288-1dfb-46c4-a958-d19f8ddcd816
01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:33.460
You can raise your hand and you
can explain your question.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89349574

bd979f1d-aecd-4553-bca8-44bbdbec46c9
01:14:39.710 --> 01:14:41.870
OK OK I got that OK thank you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9280042

f690af7f-5ae4-48aa-b1ea-a77419782294
01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:45.620
So let's move on to the next

NOTE Confidence: 0.8801845

7de0cff4-6404-4c0c-a5df-90facefbb167
01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:48.950
topic. So far we had.

NOTE Confidence: 0.09979265

35ca0dcd-9b3c-4d0f-8969-b0c7ae3ff5de
01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:50.400
Uh.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8447092

4db746c5-969d-4b49-ba71-fa60356a7820
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:56.180
Integer part, fraction part, but
all the numbers were positive.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8968223

4841462e-8d7f-42a8-81dd-5592a1bb7838
01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:00.677
So now we wanted to expand the
numbering system to have

NOTE Confidence: 0.8968223

99fb1154-4cbd-4912-8fdf-f0b753fb3114
01:15:00.677 --> 01:15:04.841
negative numbers too. So in
decimal system we have -1,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8968223

705cccca-ab93-4ba4-9173-a5dd1b3befc9
01:15:04.841 --> 01:15:06.576
-2, - 5, so let's.

ea4a31a4-c400-4ed7-92b3-e21f20c4b17e
01:15:08.150 --> 01:15:11.534
I mean, find a way to
introduce negative numbers

NOTE Confidence: 0.84132546

9469e9a0-43c9-472f-9fdb-2796668926c9
01:15:11.534 --> 01:15:12.662
in numbering systems.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7943858

6af1ec2b-f541-4fcd-812a-9aa3f4cc9447
01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:19.545
So the first uh, here's the I
mean decimal system with just

NOTE Confidence: 0.7943858

a0688416-28f8-4b05-80ec-5d4d680c8109
01:15:19.545 --> 01:15:23.595
one position from zero to 9.
These are all positive.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90256405

d07bc95c-1ca0-4f37-8d15-20792962fc7c
01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:27.588
So now we wanted to
introduce negative numbers

NOTE Confidence: 0.90256405

7263a19d-fcae-4b82-bcff-621bcefec5ab
01:15:27.588 --> 01:15:30.792
of these positive numbers.
For instance, we wanted to

NOTE Confidence: 0.90256405

29051be5-46f5-4872-8184-fc90319fd5a4
01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:33.284
have -1, -2 and etc.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9160529

6d9976b4-ab9f-43d0-b351-41cd022dd49b
01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:38.880
The immediate solution would be
just adding a new position.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8486357

7957dc6a-b2f5-45c9-8c13-cea7888e12c4
01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.760
And then put minus there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87932175

1dabe465-5855-4e40-a05c-0a232b173ab1
01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:48.919
So  -0, -1, -2, -3 and
etc. But we know that minus is

NOTE Confidence: 0.87932175

3fdb0dd3-d749-449e-9a01-1bba2e49f8ed
01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:53.563
not the is not a valid digit in
decimal system. In decimal

NOTE Confidence: 0.87932175

e92247e7-efbf-4450-b341-1baacfdc60b2
01:15:53.563 --> 01:15:55.885
system the symbols are zero to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910415

b3cbf11f-77da-4659-a04b-3e444084544e
01:15:55.885 --> 01:16:00.710
9. So instead of just using
the symbol minus, we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910415

bf005b0f-f7e2-4d08-8540-bf18e8253144
01:16:00.710 --> 01:16:05.270
assume that we put one
whenever we have one in the 10

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910415

545ca167-2d65-43e9-996e-dc50c9cea4ee
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:09.450
to the power of 1 position,
this new position. We assume

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910415

ad4de330-f6e2-4ad3-9ef8-4e4c3ce4cc5e
01:16:09.450 --> 01:16:11.350
that this number is negative.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9097151

01dd0552-ab4a-4fa3-9188-f41343b02a3b
01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:18.105
Or you can say that let's assume
any non 0 number. So as long as

NOTE Confidence: 0.9097151

4de79984-5633-4c0c-820f-a028dc0b0d89
01:16:18.105 --> 01:16:23.490
there is a non 0 value in
this new position, we can assume

NOTE Confidence: 0.9097151

7f6c0d40-7d98-46a7-88a6-4f952a3fe2ee
01:16:23.490 --> 01:16:25.285
that the number is negative.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90582734

bb3ca3c2-d570-4ab8-bd57-47c22dc8a67b
01:16:26.150 --> 01:16:30.825
But if in this location
the numbers are zero.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87317467

330c2f87-6874-44d2-9606-2a4a9f4b3cdd
01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:33.590
Then these numbers are positive.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90356785

04a4f0a9-67e8-4481-9358-d5c7eb4578fb
01:16:34.210 --> 01:16:37.785
So basically we add a new
position, but we treat this

NOTE Confidence: 0.90356785

5478e70c-bca7-43d2-9752-77b9f873bb04
01:16:37.785 --> 01:16:42.010
position as a sign, so if it
is zero it means that the

6e4ca05a-a47b-42b9-a2b9-97a49f057089
01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:45.910
number here is positive. If
it is non 0, it means that this

2c31e338-b31c-4877-b4d2-61546dc38214
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:46.885
number is negative.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8876097

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:54.020
So then you can have negative
and positive numbers with just

df7b7be8-f308-4b06-a185-b55d5dcbc348
01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:59.540
one because I mean, 1 digit. So
the positive numbers are here

73bf8d1d-707a-427d-873b-2aced01057a7
01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:02.300
with zero in the new position.

969daf16-4a1f-425a-bf39-c80e52a970e9
01:17:03.090 --> 01:17:06.654
And these are negative numbers.
You could put two or three or

NOTE Confidence: 0.8981626

20256383-f90d-472c-b946-2a7f5b657bff
01:17:06.654 --> 01:17:08.139
any non zero values here.

bdabaf7c-8485-41ad-aa18-afc7238fc29f
01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.713
I just simply put one. An
important thing is

01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:18.042
Then there is no value on the
significance of the position,

NOTE Confidence: 0.88656986

9b8e10fc-ab46-4265-901f-dc9d267481be
01:17:18.042 --> 01:17:22.162
because this position, the only
application of this position is

380498bc-6b0b-4b96-bc86-c09aa09c15fd
01:17:22.162 --> 01:17:26.282
just to introduce the sign
whether the number is positive

NOTE Confidence: 0.88656986

019ba387-cf10-4c58-92b5-1d6bde51d941
01:17:26.282 --> 01:17:31.638
or negative, so it loses the
value as the powers of 10. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.88656986

bcb139a6-91bc-4769-936d-59b5cfb4f354
01:17:31.638 --> 01:17:36.582
then we cannot assume that this
new position has any power, or 10

e8c50050-5bd8-49c0-b769-ef214f5b18c1

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:47.780
And another issue with this
system is that you have two

9557d1c8-3725-4e66-a186-857bc86c8831

01:18:15.328 --> 01:18:17.855
consider this as a
significant position. You

b7d443a9-7677-4881-9be8-97f1b8bf3332
01:18:17.855 --> 01:18:22.548
just consider it as a sign.
If it is, 0, it means that all

f6ef0be1-fc72-4819-8788-b73052d78ac4
01:18:22.548 --> 01:18:27.241
the non 0 digits in the right

non 0, it means that the number

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:36.534
So you lose one position for a
sign and you keep all the other

NOTE Confidence: 0.91026324

48fcd81a-3ef5-4015-8a28-2e4f05e15387
01:18:36.534 --> 01:18:38.289
positions for the actual value.

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:42.820
So this is called sign
and magnitude, magnitude

01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:46.380

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:52.540
So in this sign magnitude
system, because you are losing

b4843c6b-4f11-4ae4-aed2-17dcb11b560d
01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:56.050
one position, the last position
, the highest significant

01:18:56.050 --> 01:19:01.120
position. So the maximum number
is not anymore R to the power of

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:08.530
N - 1, it is R to the power of
N - 1 minus 1. So you lose one

df7a7a10-a48c-4f9f-adde-a542fdc3007a
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:15.940
this you have negative numbers
and your negative numbers

Zero up until minus the
maximum positive number.

c58112d9-ccf0-4b01-976c-f6670eedd71c
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:28.990
So the maximum positive number
if you just change the sign

f3c4eea1-9c33-4e9e-aace-e2296ee49d30
01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:30.940

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:35.848
negative. So this is the range.
So for now in the sign magnitude

ef39bc3a-d5ea-4629-bcb0-9a88a9e03f81
01:19:35.848 --> 01:19:40.558
you can represent numbers from

69103c9c-0fb7-4dae-b642-ab11cb2aac04
01:19:45.710 --> 01:19:50.018
So this is the whole range of

1a9e59ff-b750-43cc-aab3-a88a3116cb51
01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:53.608

01:19:53.608 --> 01:19:57.557

for the fraction part you don't

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:04.760
actually shows the sign, so the

a0221f6d-1ab0-4032-8e83-1d1c4b9fe188
01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:07.532
100000, which is at the

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:16.710
So as I said, then you end up
with the last four, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8469909

b1a508b7-84e8-4cff-8968-0a9bd010b755
01:26:16.710 --> 01:26:20.688
assume that there is a, I mean
a bigger number that we can

95b5415a-0c8f-46d6-aca0-c0bbca56cbd6
01:26:20.688 --> 01:26:23.748
borrow from that, and that
number is this one

e7aa79d3-49e2-4ee5-98bd-f098e6245547
01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.919
1000.000.

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:36.868
Why do you add this? Because in
this step in this is that we

2cfb6a11-32c8-4377-93e6-f007f9130aa8
01:26:36.868 --> 01:26:41.688
borrowed this number, but from
where we borrowed that, we assume

b0c064e3-075b-411d-92d9-0a6540beea5e
01:26:41.688 --> 01:26:46.990
that there is a number with
1000000 and then from that

NOTE Confidence: 0.88696843

ffc5c72f-90e8-47ed-9890-3fe729586354
01:26:46.990 --> 01:26:49.400
number we borrowed one unit.

a6a0e206-0b9b-4069-84e6-f51eefe119ed
01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:55.467
So this all comes from that
number, but when we are doing

NOTE Confidence: 0.8870532

e8363f6b-2199-4380-96f8-78c2e0299ae5
01:26:55.467 --> 01:26:59.196
the subtraction here, we assume
that there is a number. So this

b9e0c869-5e47-44df-971b-db026331d0d1
01:26:59.196 --> 01:27:03.264
is not the right result. So we
have to do another subtraction

NOTE Confidence: 0.8870532

ef5f92b5-ddf5-40d8-a1cc-95338f04db10
01:27:03.264 --> 01:27:04.620
from that higher number.
