89e4440a-7987-4ef7-b682-8bbdac8bad8c
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.774

we have to instead of just

00:06:12.253 --> 00:06:14.779
putting the. Let me just
again.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.990
Enable the laser points. Yes,
we cannot simply put

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.478
this - in a decimal position.

ce74ac45-362e-4296-8f2d-8ff4df0075bb
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.676
So we have to be said that we

ff3daa38-9fad-4297-be53-e6d4b2993da8
00:06:28.676 --> 00:06:32.678
can. Instead of just minus, we
can put one.

e0e350ed-093f-4094-873c-cfa697a3776a
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.271
Or any non zero values in order
to say that the numbers or

00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:40.955
negative and if you put zero it
means that the number is

debef618-a9e6-4a54-a59d-944065761833
00:06:40.955 --> 00:06:46.481
positive. So any non 0 value is
negative, any positive value

6d767d7a-4d39-4bb4-9f2b-d148b610aaa5
00:06:46.481 --> 00:06:53.098
is positive and 0 is positive.
So you can see that 0 to 9 positive

b39dad1e-6db9-44fe-a4e3-8fe73ef689c0
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:01.362
And one problem with this system
is that we have two zeros, minus

00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:10.266
the new position, the higher

abd5f3b1-4483-45cc-b59d-24de27b2d89c
00:07:10.266 --> 00:07:14.082
the sign doesn't have this

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:31.066
So. This system is called sign
magnitude and the reason is the

a30f02d7-016f-4629-a4b0-2f2b7333f047

means that the number is

d7f9418a-f734-44fe-bd08-4caeaaf185b2
00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:50.545
positive. If it is non zero it
means that the number is

80338f93-a6ab-46a8-ab15-4a8b8dadbada
00:07:50.545 --> 00:07:54.308

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.310
And the other locations or

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:10.647
So in this system, because we

the sign, the maximum positive
number is not anymore R to the N -

cacb6531-b565-478f-b043-88912e99914f
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.848
Maximum actually is right now
R to the power (N - 1) - 1,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8466756939888

422d671b-6625-4019-841e-cf5a5ff345df
00:08:24.848 --> 00:08:28.556
because, uh, the number of
available position for the

94821ab5-0f51-4e2f-a9c6-9f4e6369d9cb
00:08:28.556 --> 00:08:33.912
numbers are from zero to N - 2.
So the remaining position for

01449962-07ba-43ee-9cce-53e570951edc
00:08:33.912 --> 00:08:39.268
the magnitude is N - 1.
Instead we can

0de20e8b-398f-41ce-8b55-ee7b7fa234d8
00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:43.388
represent negative numbers and
the minimum number is not zero

00:08:43.388 --> 00:08:49.156
anymore. The minimum number is
minus R to the power of N - 1

-1. So basically the
maximum positive number and then

1ddfbe64-3475-4ee9-bbd9-3d29033725f1
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:59.680
we put this non 0 value in the

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.682
So for the signed position, because
plus 10 is positive, so you

9937fbd7-226f-42d1-9638-9bb98305c40c
00:11:14.682 --> 00:11:19.505

188c71f2-4971-42fb-afa6-e8da2eb00dc6
00:11:28.744 --> 00:11:31.691

any of these non 0 values are

b76eed0f-a5f6-4529-8cb8-ff685de56ed0
00:17:15.161 --> 00:17:21.116

50f159b5-8d79-490f-bd1d-d34344c79ffc
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:36.265
to. Add a positive number with
the positive another positive

0fe0b63c-f558-4bc2-b373-9cf61d0b7560
00:19:36.265 --> 00:19:40.215
numbers, so both numbers are
positive. The result is for

de36fab0-65fa-410a-8c35-07cd7d36d5c5
00:19:40.215 --> 00:19:44.955
sure, positive, so we just simply
put, the zero in the sign

41ac1591-7d92-43c9-8652-55acaf97ab79
00:19:44.955 --> 00:19:49.246
position. And then we just
normally do the addition.

NOTE Confidence: 0.890897333621979

4df2ac6a-f7c2-4e1e-a5a5-dee1e3921c21
00:19:49.246 --> 00:19:53.216
We already know how to do
that in decimal system.

e111c8ed-9845-4e11-a5c2-8d42cf434f2a
00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.832
So last session we did I
mean just addition

c34e8a0e-7849-4811-9534-57f64d055f24
00:19:58.832 --> 00:20:01.968
when we only
have positive numbers.

ef59dbe6-d7aa-4e6d-b7cc-22d11895352d
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.000
About the negative number, there is a

ede64ea3-870b-4402-b28f-3597ff858def
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.126
third addition. Add two
negative numbers, so the sign

00:20:11.126 --> 00:20:14.022
position is a non 0 value. I put

5ef0d26a-8f87-441e-b957-3dbfd8dacfd2
00:20:14.022 --> 00:20:19.745
one. So again, for sure the
result is gonna be negative, so we

NOTE Confidence: 0.870596408843994

e062ca50-943c-453e-a1ef-3d52c001968b
00:20:19.745 --> 00:20:25.555
just simply put the non 0 value
in the sign position and then we

99c7ff32-a4d1-4e54-8118-1c23712cbb00
00:20:25.555 --> 00:20:28.045
just add the magnitude of the

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.542
The difficulty is when we are
adding a positive number with a

this addition, this sign

the first number is smaller than

the second number or not.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:00.168
So this is not determined until
the results. So first we do

7e3263fa-372a-40e8-a12a-75f096146cbc
00:21:00.168 --> 00:21:04.700
normal subtraction as we did
last session and then if the

7cd1fcad-06b9-4f4f-a7c6-73deef8bc0e1
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.820
normal subtraction cause a

cbcf4041-42ed-4370-b2f1-d136f7264ba5
00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.352
apply that borrow in
order to have the correct

00:21:13.352 --> 00:21:18.708
answer. And because you have a
last borrow, we know that the 

NOTE Confidence: 0.859095215797424

8ed7e5fd-9dc6-49e9-9b64-022234e7deb4
00:21:18.708 --> 00:21:23.240
the first number was
smaller than the second number.

c9fdb683-8560-45af-b88c-abf0e3515ab7
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.888
So it means that.

f43e03d1-479f-4067-a72d-1905560a5ddb
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.880
The result is negative. So then we put

NOTE Confidence: 0.861576855182648

79ae2ca3-ae2f-4f22-816d-2cd38b8ae161
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.988
one here. But if there is, if
there is no last borrow, it

35a60d4f-4b6b-44e3-9eb9-78923b4e42b7
00:21:32.988 --> 00:21:37.642
means that X was larger than Y
and so the result is positive.

f5cecb5d-8651-40c3-96d9-7af6c20d2181
00:21:37.642 --> 00:21:41.938
So we put zero here. So the sign
position depends on whether X is

00d54ff9-7e8c-47cc-8f6c-dd25a561d929

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.340
And in order to determine this,
we have to see the result. If

means that the result is

00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:02.720
subtraction. So the easiest one
is this. When we are subtracting

46563419-72b5-40a5-9fda-ac00e85057f5
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:07.320
a positive number from a
negative number, from math in

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.380
high school, we know that minus
multiplied by minus a negative

44451440-e873-4a89-96bc-bed3684acf1e
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:21.970
So a positive number
minus a negative number becomes

6fde466a-d688-46ad-a91f-4f11e8345b06

And so we put a zero in
the sign position and then

184376fc-684d-4cf5-a3f4-daff192927b7
00:22:29.053 --> 00:22:32.410
we just normally add this

a25f04d1-683d-440c-9aad-1f75239d7450

do again subtraction.

Try 2 positive numbers and then
if there is no borrow, it means

c3f5f607-e500-4886-8fd3-477b1ae23d42
00:23:09.927 --> 00:23:14.334
that the X was larger than Y.
So the sign position is going to be

78f0ee0e-90cd-420f-8645-7b0fe5473c2e
00:23:14.334 --> 00:23:19.080

applied the last borrow in order

c3ed556a-8fa5-4242-9a8c-a76fec620df8
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.487
to find the correct answer and
the last borrow shows that X was

00:23:23.487 --> 00:23:27.555
smaller than Y so the sign
position is going to be non

ef9bd45f-54dc-483d-bbc5-b71d511e8995
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:37.529
The same way we do subtraction
of two negative numbers. So if I

00:23:41.606 --> 00:23:45.683
second negative number becomes
positive. So I mean minus

5f9de59b-a10c-4e44-a933-c97cd1460d0a
00:23:45.683 --> 00:23:49.760
multiplied by minus becomes
positive. So simply it means

f174b8ab-56ca-4e5f-991e-fdf3df6983af
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:55.196
that minus X + Y which is equal
to Y - X.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:02.000
So we simply do Y - X and wait
until the result. If the result

b93de9f3-5ab7-48fc-95a5-3163e357d126
00:24:07.122 --> 00:24:09.486
and it shows that Y was

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.898
smaller than X or in another

67d7315e-071b-4e47-a563-ab5e69570d1a
00:24:14.898 --> 00:24:19.616
that happens, you put non 0
value in order to say that the

19823ca6-db27-4dab-b72c-39bfd77dfd54

In other words, minus X was
larger than minus Y, so the

result of subtraction actually
have a borrow, you can

341a7a72-f4ff-4ef0-964e-014a8580bc6a
00:24:40.809 --> 00:24:46.020
determine the sign for the

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:54.534
Example one. Imagine we are

16. So in base-16,

071d6d2e-78dc-4abc-8539-d0c17e636c86

00:25:05.975 --> 00:25:12.670
order to represent an 11 up

have to do is just see that the

0c13dfd0-dc34-468f-8073-4742f3283496

last position is for sign,
so it's not involved in the

7dda521e-a9de-4e24-9ed0-a2952db67144

what happens, when overflow

d9eac958-a2d1-4f2a-91ec-8a3e6dc790d8

this number, which is a negative

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:31.534
So the second number is negative
because the sign position is non

ec25ef99-da87-48d8-83fb-36ae3be79aa6
01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:46.954
So then the next step is

20799d05-0f5d-4daf-88df-faff3609b433
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:16.705
We just apply the radix

So basically it means that each

01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:33.850
Becomes minus 8 by this
representation. So this is

8d778fa5-9123-4f31-9402-ecbe616a9cf1
01:20:33.850 --> 01:20:35.350
the minus 8.

4b345ca3-f979-4ca4-bac9-05c724ef28ab
01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.939
And then you have to change it

fa56655b-cf24-4eea-8b99-ab62bb201d8d
01:20:38.939 --> 01:20:43.936
with addition. So, minus plus
eight becomes plus and negative

01:20:43.936 --> 01:20:47.432
8, so the negative 8 is equal to

96cadb13-743b-48d8-acb7-5fb6ff8a824e
01:20:47.432 --> 01:20:50.880
this number. Then
do normal addition.

67c5f3eb-861b-4a69-baaa-fc01f950fdab
01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:58.436
So it produces a last Carry
and then before the last just

simply ignore that.

01:21:04.450 --> 01:21:08.506
So in the sign complement system
you just simply add 2 numbers.

the result is a positive or

01:21:27.206 --> 01:21:30.572
number is greater than this,
so this is a negative number,

1ea04d20-7dc3-4149-9bcb-a5039dcdf6a1
