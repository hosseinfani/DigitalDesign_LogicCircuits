00:07:27.954 --> 00:07:32.552
there is issue with the marking,
you can actually anticipate

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:36.732

7400ab35-3d42-4327-afb9-57ff3da9da77
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.598

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.380
So, there's no question.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8584145

13d4d14b-91eb-4a16-97df-f2cd8dc0dab2
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.654
Uh, just a quick recap of what
we said in last week. We started

NOTE Confidence: 0.8584145

9ae47333-10bd-4e3f-ab8f-754c8ffc5717
00:07:57.654 --> 00:08:01.900
the topic minimization and we
said that why it is important?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8584145

d78c8b11-83d5-4d6c-a900-581ffc8f0457
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.532
Cecause we wanted to reduce the
cost and also some other factors

NOTE Confidence: 0.8584145

67ebfc3c-c0e2-420e-9d00-e8c4a4010e19
00:08:06.532 --> 00:08:11.936
such as, I mean the area of the circuit,
you want to minimize the area of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8584145

eba1a163-b503-474b-8557-e1aa6296a676
00:08:11.936 --> 00:08:15.796
circuit sometimes because of the
limitation in the practice. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.8584145

64cbf490-7470-49c6-bc66-e09db5db1a08
00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:19.270
Minimalization was important, so
we introduced two methods. One

NOTE Confidence: 0.8584145

f7ba70cc-9834-41ee-be93-f7316b28adf9
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.744
was using the Boolean algebra or
algebraically manipulate the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8584145

1b4444b6-24ea-4807-9f8a-2f3c3d4620b1
00:08:22.744 --> 00:08:24.674
Boolean expression in order to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8169737

1874c7cb-1143-4088-96cb-380842d96204
00:08:24.674 --> 00:08:29.733
reduce the number of binary
variables and this also means

NOTE Confidence: 0.8169737

c1f04260-79f8-4643-ae36-f15745b72efe
00:08:29.733 --> 00:08:34.977
that the number of input in the
logic gate, also reducing the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8169737

4f42c01b-6b67-4ece-b786-d9de302d6bde
00:08:34.977 --> 00:08:36.288
number of gates.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79807854

f89bc6a2-dd26-45fa-9aa3-00082f3fff41
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:42.491
But we said that using the
Boolean algebra is kind of hard

NOTE Confidence: 0.79807854

25457674-dd0c-422e-89b7-3f8fb94252cf
00:08:42.491 --> 00:08:47.255
because you have to be smart,
because of the guesswork in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.79807854

59ba949d-b904-402b-aadb-c8e26833d3f3
00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:51.622
process. So you have to be
careful where and what postulate

NOTE Confidence: 0.79807854

6ecabf11-bb58-494b-bc65-5684e26f2cb9
00:08:51.622 --> 00:08:55.989
that you have to apply in order
to minimize the Boolean

NOTE Confidence: 0.79807854

7a558fff-4072-4c4f-9194-356ad91686f4
00:08:55.989 --> 00:08:59.959
expression. An important thing
was that when the number of

NOTE Confidence: 0.79807854

e4ef180b-a9d9-4654-8c63-c05db97025b4
00:08:59.959 --> 00:09:03.929
binary variables increases to 5, 6
variables and the number of

NOTE Confidence: 0.79807854

f1c3da4e-0ff1-47ac-a8d7-6ba5783cb1b1
00:09:03.929 --> 00:09:06.708
minterms or maxterms grows
for instance to 10 or 15.

NOTE Confidence: 0.846297

65697020-d5a8-446d-96f0-a24379911ebc
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.478
It's hard to keep track of the
binary variables in the minterms

NOTE Confidence: 0.846297

ab24b8ae-478d-4c81-8870-c91fab984871
00:09:11.478 --> 00:09:15.592
or maxterms and then use the
distributive postulate and other

NOTE Confidence: 0.846297

043b8e4d-2390-4241-ad5d-296b9ee0b249
00:09:15.592 --> 00:09:19.706
I mean postulates in the Boolean
algebra. And the most important

NOTE Confidence: 0.846297

b7bc0372-6651-48f4-b705-241522c3b859
00:09:19.706 --> 00:09:25.690
one is that at the end of
the day, when you use the Boolean

NOTE Confidence: 0.846297

5dde207b-f9e7-4f41-b1cc-ed45f70850f3
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.804
algebra, you're not sure that the
final expression is the minimum

NOTE Confidence: 0.846297

6a86bee8-1ca6-4124-bc21-55d1327389c6
00:09:29.804 --> 00:09:33.918
one or not, because sometimes you
might forget some postulate to

NOTE Confidence: 0.846297

1850431f-10a3-4803-974d-656a4c38139b
00:09:33.918 --> 00:09:37.284
apply, so you're not sure that

9c3bfdf2-2968-4a14-9ad3-89c228cc88b8
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.970
The answer is the minimized form
of the Boolean expression.

83806da9-e1d9-4d39-952f-a4d9e21bf047
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.775
Because of that we introduced

05f01084-5106-4cee-9139-f16048fb5e34
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:50.170
a 2nd method, which was
based on the idea proposed by

proposed a tabular or

pictorial or graphical
manipulation of the Boolean

c138b16f-06b0-465a-b279-782ff0a1ce3b
00:10:20.166 --> 00:10:25.398
you have to follow some defined
steps in order to minimize the

00:10:25.398 --> 00:10:29.758
Boolean expression and the most
important one is that the result

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.812
is guaranteed to be minimal,
so when you apply the map

method correctly, so you are
sure that the final Boolean

00:10:38.672 --> 00:10:41.760
expression is the minimized

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:49.550
So we introduced the map method.
The map of this basically based

the truth table. We said that

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:59.350
we already know that the
Boolean expression can be

represented by sum of minterms and
product of maxterms. At the end

9b049ae8-134c-4ed5-af66-a6164d98b6e4
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:10.130
we can represent the Boolean
expression as a logic circuit or

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.070
 a circuit. But as I said Karnaugh

So the map method between

the K-Map or Karnaugh map
is important.

Uh, just for your information,
there is another Karnaugh map with

different organization of minterms, 
but for the sake of I mean

actually matters. So basically.

f7eee14d-184e-408f-ac25-dc49e10b0d70
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.420
For the two variables we put X
here, either zero and one, and

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:26.810
we put Y in this part and
then either

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:32.200
zero or one. Based on this order
of getting X&Y, minterm 0 is gonna be

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:37.590
here because X is zero, Y is
zero and minterm one is gonna be

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:42.980
here, minterm two, and minterm three,
and this is the order of putting

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.830
the minterms in the Karnaugh map
for two variables.

Boolean expression using the

00:12:58.117 --> 00:13:02.320
Karnaugh map actually makes it easy
to simplify a Boolean

a9f92945-5b00-4687-9f8d-5a02d3967c78
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.056
expression. Compare the Boolean

a13d3b35-1321-4b81-a00e-5ba9eb48634c
00:13:06.056 --> 00:13:11.193
the Boolean postulates. In
order to minimize the form, or

f34f167c-56cf-496c-8855-efaf3175ef7d
00:13:11.193 --> 00:13:16.330
using the adjustment cells
happening in the Karnaugh map

f1fc5ef6-767b-4e65-ae8f-3e4a83520672
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.198
to minimize the Boolean

dbe4be46-b8dc-4f39-a4c8-89fde93d1f09
00:13:18.198 --> 00:13:22.820
expression. For instance in this
example, you see that the Boolean

114173bd-d032-47da-8310-44c061c8d32c
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.000
function is minterm one and
three. So in order to minimize

d401c20f-d629-4af7-afa2-3cdfd31230ce
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.940
it, you have to
use Boolean algebra. You have to

efe5dbf7-3aac-4ce4-9db8-a5a35363025a
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.980
apply the distributive

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.400
complement postulate. But using
the Karnaugh map, we simply say that

4a618976-f4f2-4cda-ab5c-4281fbda12e0
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.820
because these two are
adjacent, they create a region

22ce56e8-204c-480e-952a-8b145129dda2
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:47.520
of two minterms where all are one, so in
this region, X must be one and it

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.560
doesn't matter for Y, because

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.210
y can be zero or one,
so we can simply drop

Other examples and we said that
one beauty of the Karnaugh map is

00:14:04.653 --> 00:14:09.163
that you can create overlapping
regions, for instance, in this

6f2ea3db-6519-476c-bf90-ac4fd34512db
00:14:09.163 --> 00:14:13.673
example you have a two regions
with Minterm one, but,

dbb7c738-f534-420d-9b2e-3bbb756bc549
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.310
You can create this or two

00:14:24.098 --> 00:14:29.285
Boolean postulates, you have to
be a little bit smart and

76253963-dc80-4357-88b6-0fafae3deb94
00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:34.472
repeat one term because any

So you have to for instance, repeat
this term again and then kind of

00:15:31.275 --> 00:15:35.325
using the two variable Karnaugh map,
we can simply create a

Karnaugh map is that, these

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:50.000
Based on the powers of two, so
the regions you create are

f36d2755-dafd-4983-901d-1aa01d8a7d3d
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.735
either a region of one element,
a region of two Elements, a region of 4

you can create a region of 8

6a82ccb8-47d5-49f5-adfb-1a8f4d9270bc
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.358
it kind of gives you a hint that
cannot simplify the Boolean

easy way to see if you can minimize

57df4675-53af-41b1-83d1-710bca1cbaaa
00:16:54.532 --> 00:16:58.910
the Boolean expression or not.
But given the truth table and

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:04.084
Boolean algebra, you might not
be sure that there is a way to

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.301
Actually, later in the

00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:19.237
What is the pattern of the

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:27.060
it behaves or acts

called an odd

ede32972-9a4f-4df4-9b80-3426acd68162
00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:33.915
this in a lecture

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:41.302
Ah, then we move to the three
variables. So by attaching 2 two

00:17:41.302 --> 00:17:45.362

You put the X&Y, the first 2

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.106
binary variables here. They're
00, 01, and then 10

and 11.

fbe7cd43-40cc-41c1-b141-5e37d3996b90
00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.926
And the Z comes here,
either zero or one. So based

00:18:22.628 --> 00:18:26.456

is in the complement form, the

db87ba6a-33e4-463d-aab7-42eceb25b64f
00:18:26.456 --> 00:18:31.328

cd0e7479-23df-405f-ac89-d6032e96ced5
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.809
This region of Y
must be always 0.

cf752db6-5e7c-4694-bcf8-18cec0dcdb44
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.248
For the X, the middle part of
the table is in the normal form

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:46.872
of the binary variable X, because
in this region, X is always

ada9f9e6-0a6d-4165-bc14-2d1fd19457d4
00:18:46.872 --> 00:18:52.608
one. But for the compliment form

449cab28-8de3-483f-a1ce-28045e3bde4a

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:01.960
flat metal table.
It's kind of in reality, I

e213bb79-287b-4a4d-bc2f-24dcb61610ee
00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:07.504
mean in the formulation, it's
a kind of continuous

NOTE Confidence: 0.7905544

7c3891c5-4943-46a6-9353-2f8f1bcc2e04
00:19:07.504 --> 00:19:13.048
surface. So basically it's a
row, so these two edges in

NOTE Confidence: 0.7905544

0ca64c10-54ad-4c0d-b8af-ca30b0c588de
00:19:13.048 --> 00:19:18.088
fact are connected with each
other. Also these two edges.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8455899

88dd95df-84ff-4b05-8ecc-d881955e5072
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.810
This and this are also
connected with each other.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8455899

04e4bbbe-9897-4e6b-9c10-21c44d7ed1c1
00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:27.226
We will see in the four variable
Karnaugh map, so basically the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8455899

cba307a4-f31a-4765-8f46-aca40edc1b1e
00:19:27.226 --> 00:19:31.274
left side and right side of
the Karnaugh map is connected

ed945c6f-c66a-42a2-9d8a-1b9d5260a35e
00:19:31.274 --> 00:19:36.058
with each other. So the X-bar
or compliment form of the X is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8455899

62ad6bc2-eb8b-4ff2-84c4-ff8d3baefcad
00:19:36.058 --> 00:19:36.794
this region.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:43.420
m0 m4 m2 and m6, so we can
consider these regions

NOTE Confidence: 0.8015504

c1171102-2a7f-4da6-b415-44273620ff66
00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.608
continuous or adjacent.

d600166d-dbfd-4cc2-b0de-c6146d8a85fb
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.464
So we put some examples, for
instance, in this example, as you

NOTE Confidence: 0.84800035

8563bcbd-f0d0-4ef2-a9d5-d02a7e62a6a5
00:19:52.464 --> 00:19:56.666
can see it creates this Boolean
expression here that is kind of

NOTE Confidence: 0.84800035

60f4d7ab-50c7-49db-896f-836a65c853a1
00:19:56.666 --> 00:20:00.104
hard to use the Boolean
postulates to minimize it. But,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82322156

f6524036-40d9-4acd-b35b-bbbad86e6c8b
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.964
Using the Karnaugh map, you can
simply create one region here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84563744

3c8ed485-7582-45a2-b239-425205b820c6
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:09.205
And, uh, in this region the
value of X&Y doesn't matter.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84563744

2639696b-2810-4849-b90d-b65b345f2817
00:20:09.205 --> 00:20:14.175
Only thing that matters is the Z,
which must be 0 and

NOTE Confidence: 0.84563744

24a8e4db-9c81-456b-bda5-d8fe76ec5cd0
00:20:14.175 --> 00:20:18.790
then after that applying the not,
so it's the complement form of Z

NOTE Confidence: 0.84563744

ede1622d-8f16-421e-ac19-c48cbf05c4bf
00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.920
In order to make the F = one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8383665

7e485acf-43c4-4835-bcef-f9d37b5c95c4
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:26.563
And then the next region is gonna
be here. As we said, you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8383665

26b35693-ee30-480d-b86a-419fc57c6d07
00:20:26.563 --> 00:20:28.087
create a overlap region.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8212373

3d964243-7582-441d-8f37-ab135e1c170f
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:33.634
So you have two regions, one where Z must
be zero and in another one the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8212373

0863ac61-2bd7-4aa5-b5d7-48ed43e6a7b8
00:20:33.634 --> 00:20:37.906
value of Z doesn't matter. Also
the value of X doesn't matter

NOTE Confidence: 0.8212373

a6567a3a-0517-4cd0-b3c2-2437a2dd62b3
00:20:37.906 --> 00:20:42.890
because X is either 0 or 1, but the
value of Y matter. So Y must

NOTE Confidence: 0.8212373

8cd53605-6e3c-4998-b95f-b4312fb4a879
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:47.518
be one. So Y happens in the
normal form in this region, and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8212373

bc027bd8-2d47-4dcf-a184-ab223466c0fa
00:20:47.518 --> 00:20:50.722
Z happens in the complement
form in this region.

NOTE Confidence: 0.834748

607c4f90-9819-4cd0-981a-5666a07d749d
00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.404
So this is the minimized
Boolean expression. That

NOTE Confidence: 0.834748

023cb88a-3b59-469b-81ef-a6a59c735751
00:20:54.404 --> 00:20:55.616
is two steps.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82081854

c433c623-5a1d-4156-8665-17ad8dd6a3d9
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:01.704
We said that you can write the
Boolean function using the

NOTE Confidence: 0.82081854

929ff082-5d21-407e-bccd-9ccb7ce76db9
00:21:01.704 --> 00:21:06.826
Karnaugh map based on the product
of maxterms. So using the I mean

NOTE Confidence: 0.82081854

2d85fa86-4362-482d-bc21-01e3f946d64f
00:21:06.826 --> 00:21:11.160
design principle we already
know, we can look at those

NOTE Confidence: 0.82081854

20e35468-ca34-4b60-96b7-22866b84b51c
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.888
entries of zero and then write the
product of maxterms. So again it

38c8887a-4386-40bb-b9d1-523b5bd08734
00:21:15.888 --> 00:21:20.222
becomes like this and then you
have to using Boolean expression

NOTE Confidence: 0.82081854

8bdc05af-ffca-4bf3-a044-c61098e7bad7
00:21:20.222 --> 00:21:24.950
and using the Boolean postulates,
you have to be careful what

NOTE Confidence: 0.82081854

b2ec6b9e-095a-45b7-baf9-c67b1a0ea14e
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.496
Boolean postulate you have to
apply to minimize it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8557507

a608a1c0-5a5c-47d4-87f1-01fe906b6751
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.300
But if you are given
the two variable Karnaugh map, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8557507

c9c64cbd-593e-4aff-a9eb-63da5569fc27
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.000
can simply assume that instead
of writing the Boolean function

NOTE Confidence: 0.8557507

e2238c11-7f7e-4f20-ad01-f2e52c143c98
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.070
for those entries with one, you
can write the Boolean function

NOTE Confidence: 0.8557507

f67e7961-7293-4876-ad07-627288e4014e
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:46.510
for those entries with zero,
but this time for F prime. So we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8557507

6c0a5189-6414-4c68-bce8-aa1f86adcbb7
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:50.580
can simply assume that these
regions are one and the other

NOTE Confidence: 0.8557507

d85ace55-f866-49b3-bb6b-1533bd651c70
00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.650
regions are zero and then write
the Boolean function for F

NOTE Confidence: 0.8285161

76f123c0-2a53-443d-949c-709769567ea2
00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:59.574
prime. So when you simplify the
F prime, you can apply another

NOTE Confidence: 0.8285161

1d093bcf-25c9-4bdd-96ea-fe65955920a8
00:21:59.574 --> 00:22:03.786
not on top of the F prime, so F
prime prime becomes F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86711115

2d624706-9294-499a-a094-bb6e0dbd6d52
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:09.520
So this is the minimize form of the F
prime. So in this region Z must

cc0d2172-30a9-42c3-af62-dc98fafd793a
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.510
be one. And Y must be 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.892866

eb05e8ec-d90d-440f-bc94-88dd957f2f78
00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:18.034
But the value of X doesn't
matter because X is either one

NOTE Confidence: 0.892866

623b8cb9-8b36-4a80-8fc7-1e28265081fc

or zero in this region.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7364591

0102ab28-f05d-4b5a-b138-3f05286a02da
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.940
So this is the minimized form of
the F prime, so you have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7364591

39b36d0f-ab3f-45af-8d25-167f0dc3ce3d
00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.160
apply another not, so ZY' bar.

1fea24bc-831b-4beb-b515-eacdc78ccc7a
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:34.480
Bar becomes the F, so if you
apply the De Morgan's postulate, let's

10cd5298-5275-4ef2-b3bc-31d0882b9881
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:40.930
so (ZY')' becomes Z' + Y. This
this is the way we use the

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:45.660

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:55.475
So you can see that the Karnaugh
map is able not only to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8837774

40f631c5-2195-42df-a762-8da927aebc63
00:22:55.475 --> 00:22:59.270
minimize the sum of products,
but also it is able to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8837774

6a887546-4fe8-4c75-b3df-6a59c125c600
00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.995
minimize the product of sums.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82142895

32fde812-c707-471d-bede-0d7122d33a1c
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:07.796
So this is the summary. The left
side is the Boolean expression

NOTE Confidence: 0.82142895

dd3b5420-2721-45c5-80cd-81a55eefed57
00:23:07.796 --> 00:23:11.926
and we wanted to apply the
Boolean postulates to minimize

NOTE Confidence: 0.80477387

3aea8660-17ec-400b-b40a-3f4bbd429a1b
00:23:11.926 --> 00:23:16.885
it. But in the right side you
have two Karnaugh maps. One is the 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8316212

06be9b0d-d8c1-481f-ae1e-5fc4720a238e
00:23:16.885 --> 00:23:20.795
sum of products to minimize it. And one is
for the product of Maxterms.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8316212

9509daf4-5b8d-4280-9da0-7384f2cced06
00:23:20.795 --> 00:23:24.455
But again, as you can see
here, the final result is the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8316212

a9519519-5170-4d4f-afaf-98dcd2ab5fa0
00:23:24.455 --> 00:23:25.370
same in both

NOTE Confidence: 0.79846275

30056850-a77a-402d-be89-0788ba37599e
00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:27.730
Approaches.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817481

a11a4a66-5078-49e3-ae81-86fc1161733c
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.552
So this is another example of,
for instance, if you're given

NOTE Confidence: 0.817481

c25b7509-b7b3-4965-a9c6-a8f8e0ee9251
00:23:34.552 --> 00:23:38.534
this Boolean function, so again,
it's hard to minimize

NOTE Confidence: 0.817481

1a62acd8-02cb-4d5b-b337-8ac0d3fee53d
00:23:38.534 --> 00:23:42.516
this Boolean function
using the Boolean postulates, but

NOTE Confidence: 0.57799286

16378097-56a5-4b21-9328-4a1f46f7c7d4
00:23:42.516 --> 00:23:47.610
here, using the Karnaugh map,
this is the minterm 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.81760913

5e00f3f0-a8e8-4868-a25a-d81d07275240
00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:55.356
Minterm one is 0 and
then 0 1 2 3. So the minterm two

NOTE Confidence: 0.81760913

881e849d-54dc-4e4b-a000-e3cd7ab0beee
00:23:55.356 --> 00:24:01.453
is gonna be one, and then 4 5 6 7. So
base on this arrangement of

NOTE Confidence: 0.81760913

9c788d92-3f9a-4602-85aa-4ded8647f6a5
00:24:01.453 --> 00:24:08.019
minterms, you just put the
minterms with value one in the Karnaugh map.

NOTE Confidence: 0.81760913

caefd8f5-30a4-48be-b71b-2c8ac58d9c8a
00:24:08.019 --> 00:24:14.116
So again here if you are going
to create the adjacent cells and

NOTE Confidence: 0.81760913

efd61457-7c94-4cbb-b2c7-847e01fa6547
00:24:14.116 --> 00:24:18.806
create a regions or groups of
minterms,  those with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8226819

49edbe9c-3399-4eee-92c6-203993ba7fbd
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:24.596
the value one in the
cell. As I said, Karnaugh map is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8226819

d819ab31-fd83-4e9f-90e7-9080400d1ef2
00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:29.324
a kind of continuous
surface, so the left and right

NOTE Confidence: 0.8226819

2080e4fd-9de3-4509-b130-24686430be11
00:24:29.324 --> 00:24:33.658
side is attached. At first you
could create two regions, one

NOTE Confidence: 0.8226819

f3f9107d-346d-43f5-a8af-041967c19665
00:24:33.658 --> 00:24:38.386
region here and one region here.
So each of them actually removes

NOTE Confidence: 0.8226819

791d6547-b2b0-4ce2-8e70-02531caf2b3c
00:24:38.386 --> 00:24:39.568
one binary variable.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8194778

61e2a299-f788-43f1-9f2b-5bef9c0561d2
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:44.540
But you can create a region with
four cells.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8603531

118f6f38-7c65-4f16-9ace-c5cf3815220f
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:49.978
Uh, and then because four is 2
to the power of two, it removes

NOTE Confidence: 0.8603531

84b22f49-f030-4ed4-9a41-e7065515b3fe
00:24:49.978 --> 00:24:54.424
two binary variables. So in this
region, as you can see here, the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8603531

8caa6a07-63ee-47db-9587-5c06b9505888
00:24:54.424 --> 00:24:58.186
value of Z doesn't matter,
because in this region Z is either

NOTE Confidence: 0.8603531

e4fbec18-c8d0-4c6f-b7e4-b32cababe6ca
00:24:58.186 --> 00:24:59.212
one or zero.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86255324

5a898ac5-8045-4876-8718-b906db83238b
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:04.934
And the value of U doesn't
matter, because again, in this

NOTE Confidence: 0.86255324

23beb326-0efa-40d7-b985-499d2f64ac31
00:25:04.934 --> 00:25:09.770
region, in this green region, Y
is either 0 or either one. The only

NOTE Confidence: 0.86255324

f433be7d-640d-4cf4-a2d5-8c4452327939
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:14.234
variable, which must actually
matters is the value of X, so X

NOTE Confidence: 0.86255324

1a876627-630b-44f8-a1b0-e9a685fb4191
00:25:14.234 --> 00:25:20.186
must be 0 in this region, so we
have to say that F is equal to

NOTE Confidence: 0.86255324

d416c0f6-cd21-49c4-a948-d87430f0bef2
00:25:20.186 --> 00:25:23.906
the complement form of X,
because whenever X is zero,

NOTE Confidence: 0.86255324

8678422d-ae0e-4593-a12d-18b25dc1e6d6
00:25:23.906 --> 00:25:25.394
X bar gonna be 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84195024

494a410f-2884-4fe1-9ac5-d8e144243f29
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.355
This is the way you minimize
this function. Again, you could

NOTE Confidence: 0.84195024

4d8097f8-91a2-434b-8b15-df6ed5c6a475
00:25:31.355 --> 00:25:35.975
say that I just wanted to
consider the Maxterm, so just

NOTE Confidence: 0.84195024

08717be2-8ea3-4581-9ee3-1d564a54b995
00:25:35.975 --> 00:25:40.210
those entries that makes the
Boolean function 0. So with this

NOTE Confidence: 0.84195024

29a6f6b3-2199-4588-b952-c099a6c893e9
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:45.215
one, with the Karnaugh map, you can
create a a region of 4 adjacent

NOTE Confidence: 0.84938425

8f5a44c5-ed20-4c98-a525-6e6fae5a74fb
00:25:45.215 --> 00:25:50.764
elements. We apply bar for the F bar,
so that's why you just put the

NOTE Confidence: 0.84938425

c075019c-8d7e-4cd4-9c6d-491d33df03d1
00:25:50.764 --> 00:25:54.691
final not here and then you try
to minimize inside the

NOTE Confidence: 0.84938425

ffe045ac-ecdb-4fb6-a302-7280cb0052e8
00:25:54.691 --> 00:25:57.547
parenthesis. Inside the
parenthesis, if you assume that

NOTE Confidence: 0.84938425

291bb400-efb6-43bd-9899-c55b8ecd638f
00:25:57.547 --> 00:26:01.117
this is for F bar, all these
entries becomes one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85941297

7455e809-b847-400a-ba40-4bee7bf7d5b8
00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:06.455
And all the other entries with
value one becomes 0. So then you

NOTE Confidence: 0.85941297

6439d2c8-add5-432e-aee7-73c856fec3f2
00:26:06.455 --> 00:26:10.940
can simplify this region, this
region is when the X is gonna be 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8024085

9d6ede16-7de2-4895-916e-1cc0c43809f1
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.724
So you put X here. This
is the minimize form for F bar.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7849532

3882b989-a594-4405-9f90-fe73d6bdd42d
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.044
For F prime. So you apply
another not to make it

NOTE Confidence: 0.7849532

200a0c49-4fba-4a19-a6ca-ef8d30d3daed
00:26:20.044 --> 00:26:23.718
F, so it becomes X-bar. So
the same as the previous one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8297914

f59b00f0-6d1c-44a1-84f6-8fd0d958e863
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:32.065
Oh, one thing here is that it
 must be F(Z,Y,X) so it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8297914

d4097b96-ef8a-4b6f-b2ce-b2027750f16c
00:26:32.065 --> 00:26:36.234
of three variables instead of two.
So there's a MISTAKE here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7624897

9dae58a6-d108-44c7-9b01-8723760a9d80
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:43.468
I'll fix it when I posted, 
when I gotta post it

00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:48.109
in Blackboard. OK next,
let's move on to the next

cca389ea-77ec-4508-98dd-5a31b4477e18
00:26:48.109 --> 00:26:50.965
Karnaugh map, which is a four

fcd99e67-4862-43ed-832a-72740b6851f4

98f370d5-e139-46d8-bef8-2dc065c12e4c
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:03.012
So if there is any question
I'm ready to take your

491d20ed-f679-40d7-9857-1c5a8bd620ef
00:27:03.012 --> 00:27:04.290
questions so far.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8096856

0fef7cf9-d252-47e4-b934-27151e5a3d8f
00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.030
Let me close this one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86051524

cb3c6ce2-1f32-48a2-964e-9f4d3f5b011c
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.060
Any questions?

NOTE Confidence: 0.90635216

55e6d063-8c31-4df4-8a32-badf1426ec0d
00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.709
OK, that's OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.54348505

e601b998-b72e-4a30-86b1-adff0949d08b
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.228
Enable the laser pointer.

b72b94df-dbe3-4214-a8e5-d90318cccdef
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:01.700
Nice.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8543526

48a8b712-4979-4182-83aa-633173806fbd
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:07.950
So the next Karnaugh map is going
to be a Karnaugh map for four variables.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8318207

d7a183f3-ba54-4414-b55d-e243371e6ba0
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:14.719
So for the 4 variables, this
is the Karnaugh Map, so the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.8318207

ba5096a1-0cb4-473d-a1fc-8ccafbe719e1
00:28:14.719 --> 00:28:20.395
2 variables goes in the column
side, so X&Y and again, pay

NOTE Confidence: 0.8318207

341204e3-298a-4d9a-8f57-6a2e4eac9751
00:28:20.395 --> 00:28:27.017
attention to the order. So here
is the value of Y. Here is the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8318207

642525d4-98f9-40d2-b466-a071160094c9
00:28:27.017 --> 00:28:28.909
value of X. So 00 01.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8493048

8c6f5a33-4ca0-44c6-a239-1448a8ae7cc4
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:34.622
And then comes here 10 11. 11
means that the value of X is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8493048

d9e26f36-0195-4069-a5d9-c8c3ea5e379d
00:28:34.622 --> 00:28:39.674
1 and the value of Y is 1. And the
other, the next two variables

NOTE Confidence: 0.8493048

529cabdb-67b4-4ef2-9ce4-5f1ff2f8bfe5
00:28:39.674 --> 00:28:45.147
comes here, WZ, so then
00 01 and then comes here

NOTE Confidence: 0.8493048

353749cc-9583-4d87-8132-8eb09ec8ebcb
00:28:45.147 --> 00:28:49.357
11 10. So this is the
arrangement 00 01 and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.8493048

ea0eb490-dad2-45e4-84fe-083b87c1640f
00:28:49.357 --> 00:28:54.409
goes here, 10 and then 11.
And based on this arrangement,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8493048

7bfa8173-0a2e-491e-af17-56b0e3c3231d
00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:59.040
I mean allocation of the
minterms, it is going to be like

dea8ae4c-a607-4690-9dfb-74a0acb86768
00:28:59.040 --> 00:28:59.461
this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.873905

c99d79f1-4d8f-479f-a36c-d31d5a666310
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:06.230
So as you can see here, the 1st
two rows are the same as the

6afd1acf-bee1-4b18-8eab-f1d60b6da1bf
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:10.388
Karnaugh with three variables, so
minterm 0 1 and then comes here 2

0b154662-dfbb-4f87-a11d-88868ea41ee3
00:29:10.388 --> 00:29:15.302
3 and then comes here 4 5 and then
comes here 6 7. And then it

40e7e84d-7fe5-4ea5-8cf3-d17719338e29
00:29:15.302 --> 00:29:16.436
goes to the

039fb827-ba25-408e-8ba2-e03199d6cc8d
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:23.020
Other side, so the other two rows is
going to be here, so it starts

bea4fa58-e349-451d-9397-a32bb1b1a2d8
00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.115

5aa7ec2a-6b56-48ff-b0b1-700a08b3c39b
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:31.089
10 11, comes here, 12 13, and then
goes here for 14 15 so it ends

NOTE Confidence: 0.8335916

19381a9d-edea-4138-9e86-346b4fb9d483
00:29:31.089 --> 00:29:37.368
in this cell, where all the
variables are one. So in the m15

NOTE Confidence: 0.8335916

823aca77-629d-417c-9c54-42a41cd9f764
00:29:37.368 --> 00:29:40.266
all the variables XY is gonna

00:29:40.266 --> 00:29:44.289
be 1. And then Z and W are
gonna be 1.

20f071f7-61f1-429b-8859-2805d0c16781
00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:49.320
As I said, there is another

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:58.695
you cannot simply say that you
can put in minterms as you wish

f6d59f67-bcfe-4cdd-80fb-ce4b42c3e505
00:29:58.695 --> 00:30:02.532
and then simplify the

d765f555-a660-4b59-ae54-dab4b09f55fb
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:13.260
So let's practice on the four
variable Karnaugh map. Imagine

708b1804-2fc1-41e7-96e0-f017c9768179
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.319
you're given this Boolean
function XYZW and these are,

af279c81-0523-478b-b7aa-f5f3ff0a28c2
00:30:17.319 --> 00:30:22.731
this Boolean function is
equal to minterm 0, 1 up until

00:30:22.731 --> 00:30:27.692
14. So again, imagine you were
supposed to apply the Boolean

c67cbdb6-92ff-42fd-ad6b-d82352b25656
00:30:27.692 --> 00:30:33.104
postulates. So there are lots of
minterms here and there are four

26aa914e-834a-442e-bce3-c4f18591abdc
00:30:33.104 --> 00:30:38.065
variables, so it's kind of hard to
use the Boolean algebra or

NOTE Confidence: 0.6142517

bc46be61-7e23-4488-9bca-fe13d7830827
00:30:38.065 --> 00:30:39.900
algebraic methods to minimize this Boolean

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:45.300
function. WE are using this 4
variable Karnaugh map, so you can

7c9972fa-0285-4526-a89c-dbc8dc07df39
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:50.640
simply just put the entries with

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:55.535
question, so the minterm 0, 1, 2, etc.
So this minterm is gonna be 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80582553

4b2bdc17-3428-4b22-aa63-6e088d0b5cc9
00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.040
And other minterms gonna be 0.

2c69548a-4eac-415f-9576-db1f5d60de2a
00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.986
And then using this
pictorial

bbc6846a-330f-472f-8f40-ee8b71962d2c
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:09.551
I mean map, or pictorial table
can simply create some regions

00:31:12.679 --> 00:31:15.025
So the first is gonna be here.

55355dd2-f9a8-4d48-8229-ecca9d63d47f
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:21.748
So as you can see here, you can
create a region of eight cells

dc4820d3-3aed-44fd-9943-1bdcd173ce39
00:31:21.748 --> 00:31:26.519
adjacent to each other. So
eight is 2 to the power of

fc8abe15-f3d0-4453-b121-f0deddead21a
00:31:26.519 --> 00:31:30.189

remove three binary variables.

234052c0-c444-46f2-9f4c-92c72219a5b8
00:31:30.189 --> 00:31:35.327
So in this area, you can see that
the value of W doesn't matter,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609785

f2c143d6-c142-4dfd-96a1-8f3084632c48
00:31:35.327 --> 00:31:37.529
because in those, in this area.

3e7af77b-7058-46c3-8cd5-af6729435196
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.826
Z is either 0 or 1, W is either
0 or 1, so you can simply remove

00:31:42.826 --> 00:31:47.012
these two and then again in this
area, the value of X doesn't

zero or one. So the only thing tjat

b7786081-07b0-4ac1-82ac-3984b70055c1
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:56.028
matters is the value of Y. So
Y is gonna be 0 in this

b508f73a-27f1-40da-83f1-3700652394b5
00:31:56.028 --> 00:32:00.214
region, so you have to apply the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8460851

499cf08a-4190-443f-9abf-a4fc5e081d6f
00:32:00.214 --> 00:32:01.824
here. So let's fix this.

cbf55441-ac02-43ed-ab83-41f82345d7db

00:36:24.048 --> 00:36:29.184
these cells, all these cells are
adjacent to these cells. So for

11457d81-ce31-4f08-8c53-8b45a2be955f
00:36:29.184 --> 00:36:34.320
these ones with value one, you
can simply say that these two

NOTE Confidence: 0.82402825

9a0b882d-dfa2-4b02-aa80-e76a2ec36779
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:39.028
and these two in the left is
creating a new adjacent

00:36:39.028 --> 00:36:42.880
region. So then in this region
the value of

3fbe6d45-808e-4dd2-867c-7f0266525c6a
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:48.916
W doesn't matter because in
this region the value of Y is

17e9fdac-ffcc-484f-a096-e0e5259e0385
00:36:48.916 --> 00:36:50.428
either one or zero.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84823763

cdbd6390-267b-47e7-9458-3e773770b2dd
00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:55.040
The only thing that matters is the
value of X here because X

1d6e3f30-c610-46a2-ad12-a11826a12c04
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.265
must be zero and for the Z&W,
the value of Z doesn't matter

NOTE Confidence: 0.84823763

1915a428-0b2d-476d-a9ca-4b50141feb68
00:36:59.265 --> 00:37:02.840
because in this region, the
value of Z is either 0 or 1 but

NOTE Confidence: 0.84823763

c4dbd7af-9ef4-4ad5-870e-c21d93386595
00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.090
the value of W matters
because it must be 0.

2ac7309b-d307-4393-8b66-268d066699a8
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:12.780
So by creating a new region of
four cells, 2 to the power of

NOTE Confidence: 0.85657644

4673dd3a-a3ee-48a9-900a-5af7524e6e5f
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:17.640
two, so you can simply drop two
binary variables and those two

8fd1b759-a991-4298-9ad9-a465233728ec
00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.260
binary variables are Y&Z.

496c3346-b1bf-4ca1-8cdf-0cdc2f372819
00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:27.728
Also, for this one, for
these two you can say that these

e2631b3b-00c1-440a-8a7e-9ac76b50a7c6

69d71a60-02bc-4fad-b8af-ff9b052f3962
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:36.801
So you can simply create a new
region here, this one and this

ea906f5f-b9f2-4b40-9fb7-59f2df109148
00:37:36.801 --> 00:37:42.779
one, and then in this region if
you check, the values of X&Z only

NOTE Confidence: 0.8907777

6be0cf84-aa11-49ef-a66e-ea5d20e97f46
00:37:42.779 --> 00:37:45.341
matters because X must be 0.

377b52e1-ae65-475e-80fb-fcf59230bf7f
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:51.393
And Z must be one and the
other two variables, Y&W

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:58.246
And
this is the simplified Boolean

NOTE Confidence: 0.8888875

7a97b2d8-df00-449d-8b59-8c7efa9f1bcc
00:37:58.246 --> 00:38:00.622
expression and this is the logic

00:38:00.622 --> 00:38:05.642
circuit. Again, there's a TYPO
here. Y must be Y-bar. So I

8bb8caf8-cf46-4992-83e0-fb2887154cdd
00:38:05.642 --> 00:38:10.276
have to add a not operator here.
One thing is that you might see

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:20.818
Ah, as you can see here in this

X, Y, Z&W. But we don't have any
wire for a not, we don't

have a wire for X-bar. 
We don't have wire for

00:38:31.062 --> 00:38:36.054
that. Sometimes it makes it very

00:38:36.054 --> 00:38:41.878
more wires, so another way to
show not is this, you can

7d665e2e-a8f7-4489-a5ac-5877ebf43b92
00:38:41.878 --> 00:38:46.454
simply just add a slash here,
meaning that Y reflects, so it's a kind

b8873b46-912f-4e5f-8802-122c026c87d3

of not. And then it becomes
Y-bar. For instance, here we have X

28c7efaa-c549-4ee5-a4ab-1d1f1d878887
00:38:52.387 --> 00:38:57.945
slash, which means X-bar. So, I
mean adding a slash on top of

00:39:06.414 --> 00:39:08.649
there's a not gate here.

4f67e939-97d5-48ac-ab4b-fff01531ce38
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:36.430
So let's minimize the
Boolean expression

6b58c9e4-39a8-4a93-ac88-7055841e6345
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:40.108
By using the product of Maxterms.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7931416

eb902a7a-3336-4bd3-a878-c4417792b7ae
00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:45.367
So again, for the product of
maxterms, you will look for those

NOTE Confidence: 0.7931416

b411ed72-5e12-4c37-8c38-a750a4203c71
00:39:45.367 --> 00:39:49.537
cells with zero or entries of 0,
that makes the Boolean function

NOTE Confidence: 0.7931416

27dbe424-2515-4618-836f-4bf6d8067d66
00:39:49.537 --> 00:39:51.205
zero in the output.

d796766b-38a3-4adf-8347-54192ffb5c6f
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:56.959
So these are the regions, so 1
region and this is the second

cf52d847-4cae-443b-a2a6-d54f41e7ce31

region that makes the Boolean

00:39:58.924 --> 00:40:03.380
function 0. So you could simply
say assume that you are trying

e164fff9-d0dc-4f94-ab46-34a22dec01a0
00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:06.746

e9397377-4a5d-4a43-a5e5-2ac4956b3887
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:11.508
And then minimize it using the
Karnaugh Map, so for using this

e68a6bf4-8413-4d04-9c5b-170c16d4ae4d
00:40:11.508 --> 00:40:14.898
you could simply just assume
that You're minimizing

00:40:14.898 --> 00:40:16.254
for the F bar.

a8de6124-a496-43d0-abbb-7dd1c32f2853
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:21.800
And this region simplifies
the Boolean expression by

NOTE Confidence: 0.83763635

4869a8d5-b88e-46d9-9613-34ee13fd9352
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:27.404
removing because it has four

00:40:27.404 --> 00:40:32.541
two, it removes two binary variables and
those variables are this, so in

8c0fbdcd-1948-4ae7-865e-242164852661
00:40:32.541 --> 00:40:35.343
this region, X must be one.

31a4bf48-eb66-487b-b296-cd9eff0afc38
00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:41.175
Y must be one and the values
of Z&W doesn't matter, so it

6b79a14a-2587-45a2-b4df-d62dc1f54690
00:40:41.175 --> 00:40:42.330

But followed by not.

477eb19e-3663-4459-b015-8aebd5d93aff
00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:53.318
X&Y not so it's kind of. I
mean meaning that it becomes one

606c6129-fdd6-48c5-9949-46249eb9ab39
00:40:53.318 --> 00:40:58.678

is this region.

4c171716-4685-43bd-afbf-e6d7503d18b2
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:03.232
So for this reason, you could
assume that this region is 1 and

b10ebeb9-cf15-4cba-b0ed-a5118ed8b783
00:41:03.232 --> 00:41:06.760
then simplify it and then
followed by the not, so for this

076456a4-970b-463e-967b-2da572df600a
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.994
region, the simplified version is,
because the value of X doesn't

The only thing matters is the

ab41f189-1c66-4686-93f0-3c950a8b07c5
00:41:20.345 --> 00:41:27.465
in this region W must be one, Z
must be 0 and Y must be one

6e215e0d-6d9f-46a2-ae7d-079a7a689257

followed by not.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:36.302
So and then you can bring the
not inside the parenthesis and

096b9eb6-5eb4-439b-9c1d-e8c0891dea7c
00:41:36.302 --> 00:41:41.054
it becomes by the De Morgan's law,
it becomes Y prime or X prime

00:41:41.054 --> 00:41:45.410
for the first parenthesis. For
the next one it is Y prime.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.232
So this is the way you can use
the Karnaugh map to minimize the

b7ba3e80-a909-4559-8cf8-b3fd17a079f8

87abff96-ab09-4267-82fb-a2c06f3c173e
00:42:54.893 --> 00:42:57.350
then make a torus out of that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8109637

e030be0f-a457-4080-b283-ccbfbebf9d40
00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:02.770
So again, I mean a flat surface.
The edges are these two edges

NOTE Confidence: 0.8109637

7605fbca-fe73-4916-a71b-88660b499e46
00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:06.470
are connected. Make your role
and then these edges also

NOTE Confidence: 0.8109637

413e8bdd-2e87-4c2e-aa29-e26d5ba772d5
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:07.950
connected. Make it torus.

NOTE Confidence: 0.81934935

67f1ea6f-e1d0-4903-8b00-a5e808875103
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.700
So you can find this in the
Wikipedia, so again the surface

NOTE Confidence: 0.81934935

2ba02f86-aa04-4bdc-adbb-ec3cf7b1c146
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.625
roll and then a tarus.

1877015f-732a-4fc6-a360-e905263b2e1e
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:26.210
So that's what I mean when
I say that the Karnaugh map

NOTE Confidence: 0.8802933

1fa67ad0-7ceb-46ef-8f52-4721789a6530
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:27.590
is continuous surface.

f32fda17-abd2-4e7e-af3c-0aa5aeca2580
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:31.310
So let's move on to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9108271

7a51a431-1b4b-407d-beaa-f642d11a6e26
00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.140
The next slide so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.78881687

5ea666cb-7d43-40f9-a56e-6253898ee06d
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.128
by this I mean? I mean, uh,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8268485

96c6c731-e91e-4425-a0c7-b85cbfacd51b
00:43:39.128 --> 00:43:43.678
when you. Assume that the Karnaugh
map is the continuous surface.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7509789

e2394ca6-83c3-4d01-9893-0546e8807141
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.269
Corner of the Karnaugh map. As you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8076884

f7532ca0-6844-4a89-90ce-59f6f861c4f0
00:43:46.269 --> 00:43:51.362
can see here. So this edge is
connected to this edge also.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8076884

c82f0bbd-6ae7-4aa1-a30d-1395c3dedbc3
00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:57.074
This edge is connected to this,
so as a result the corner of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8076884

da85664e-ad7b-4dea-8485-3c68269cd347
00:43:57.074 --> 00:44:01.970

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:06.866
other. So is I mean dots
showing the corner of the Karnaugh

NOTE Confidence: 0.8076884

99f74f33-8c92-414b-953b-88a6dca01a09

1bedbd24-cc47-4bd0-9e66-a96cc9c7bd1f
00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:14.959
So whenever you see I mean one
in these areas in the corner

NOTE Confidence: 0.832292

688adebc-75af-404e-b608-e243013fb694
00:44:14.959 --> 00:44:19.795
of the Karnaugh map and create a
adjustment region. Or you can

06ab2d72-1836-4ddc-abe9-959e8b516906
00:44:19.795 --> 00:44:22.616
create the shared region with
adjustment cells.

a249ddc1-c18b-43bc-ba20-662a12ca7f1d
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:27.656
So whenever you see a min term 0 2.

58215340-0f49-4b10-a6ac-30fd0fcc46af
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:52.246
The value of y doesn't matter.
The reason is y is either one

matter because in this region

5a39b4ee-eb8b-4ecd-b771-99f7be3b9d4a
00:45:00.874 --> 00:45:04.026
the value of W is either one or

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.859
Is Z' X'?

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:21.696
So remember these corners that
you can attach the corners to

fe3a74dd-9b79-449e-bb7b-f4f0e4dbf375
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:36.735
Also I mean by using the product
of the Max terms and here as you

00:45:36.735 --> 00:45:42.387
can see product of the Max

For , five and etc. As
you can see here, 3 2 5 an etc. So

00:45:50.542 --> 00:45:54.843
again, I mean by using the
product of max term .2 overlapping

56325b12-b6bd-4f1d-9efd-cad342fb6d2c
00:45:54.843 --> 00:45:58.753
I mean region one. Is this an

01daffc5-9619-4042-b1fd-1ed93c3e4e25
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.390

ccd8787a-f4e7-464f-8fee-e480acc0b625

00:46:09.423 --> 00:46:15.680
the nots. So you can see at

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:57.407
And then by that you are
simplifying the Boolean term or

designed this by just simply

00:48:54.617 --> 00:48:56.189
using the truth table.

00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:04.106
So, and that was the truth
table, we said that if the two

22cd97da-357d-4456-a2ef-f8e74fc41ebd
00:49:04.106 --> 00:49:09.462
binary numbers are just in the
range of zero and three. So we

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:09.330
For instance, here I said that
let's assume X one is X, X2 is

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:17.860
So based on this change of

affad16d-bfdf-4cce-b952-bb00dbf4eed7
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:27.790
Like this FX because X one is x
Y, X2 becomes Y Y, one become Z&Y

00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:32.982

00:56:41.566 --> 00:56:46.364

order to minimize this based on
the Max terms in the Karnaugh map,

c8eeffac-2bf2-44c5-a2ca-08ca430c5b73
00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:25.130
you have to consider those

00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:32.441

assume they are one.

there are zero, it helps us

with more simplification. We
can assume there are zero, so

it's kind of an assumption.
So the value of don't care

we could assume there are zero

But just for the
