00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.648
So let's start. Although
there are very few students

7b5f2183-ee0a-4591-8274-08a3b28fa093
00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:12.024
in the class, we have only
12 students.

58c3353a-fc71-4ed4-bee4-23b27e863c68
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.808
Let's just start and
hopefully other students

Let's start, uh. We are
going to continue our topic

NOTE Confidence: 0.83940023

b6f0d21a-8158-44ec-b936-cb8a4e71b7f6
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.160
on sequential logic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9265972

daf8ddcd-bbdd-4b1e-90ca-17020e3a9901
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.598
Just a quick recap.

NOTE Confidence: 0.07836193

4250806b-8fdc-44e4-909d-491a51e06fc9
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.110
Uh.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8141277

89f72687-825e-47ec-bd6d-792e61fe3740
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.365
We start with building a unit
that memorizes a bit or a state

NOTE Confidence: 0.8141277

6a11a444-3769-49ae-af35-1839d2f7fc69
00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:28.140
so we call that a latch,
and then we set up the latch to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8141277

1aff7827-7389-4ff2-9916-7a9495917e1e
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.990
be synchronized by the Clock,
either by a positive level or

NOTE Confidence: 0.8141277

59018486-1f1b-4597-a34e-7ce07a20ffea
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.840
negative level, meaning that
when the Clock becomes one, it

NOTE Confidence: 0.8141277

670bfb3e-a0c7-49d9-bd64-398c03037340
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.460
accepts the input to change the
internal state of the latch. It is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8141277

fd5fa3b8-644f-431f-95cf-9e9bd083ddc8
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.465
kind of a door or for the
negative level, I mean, when the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8141277

8dee300b-5536-4512-a70f-7db4169859e3
00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:46.620
Clock becomes 0,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7976227

78149666-167d-472a-8424-373c6fd70abb
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.400
it enters the value of
the input of the latch in order

NOTE Confidence: 0.7976227

5fbf0de7-9a8d-4b77-b1d5-814ddc35b06e
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.275
to change the state of the
latch. Then we said that we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.7976227

5d1b058b-270c-464d-8f66-abb667c51f73
00:01:57.275 --> 00:02:01.775
improve that design to have a
flip flop, meaning that we just

NOTE Confidence: 0.7976227

9445d3c1-44dd-44ae-a0c9-44002df6dcd2
00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:05.900
accept the input at one moment,
either the positive edge or

NOTE Confidence: 0.7976227

5c1a39b2-184e-47c0-b55e-1766733a4717
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.400
negative edge or both edges.
So basically a flip flop based

NOTE Confidence: 0.7976227

23506438-e774-453b-b2f6-4ad3e4ebec5a
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.275
on our design is a single edge
triggered latch. So if a latch,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7976227

057b7b54-50ee-4305-b185-7245de65ed02
00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:17.900
either RS, JK, D or T latch.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8991589

55b0fc8f-a653-4982-b07d-5fad5a3ff3f0
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.958
If they is gonna accept the input
only at the moment that the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8618338

c2f6d8f5-f06b-4e02-b5f3-030cb81ab8fe
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.576
Clock transits from zero to 1,

NOTE Confidence: 0.81755567

5096a6a1-40a4-4679-a259-0fcc0cb8da75
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.074
we call that a positive edge, or
from 1 to 0 a negative edge. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.81755567

4b6366bc-145f-4fbf-bb22-e95ee4527293
00:02:31.074 --> 00:02:35.551
basically any single edge trigger
latche is a flip flop. So to

NOTE Confidence: 0.81755567

583d7c63-ad11-48a9-9a60-3d154c538c0c
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:40.842
show the flip flops, we said that
the block diagram has a

NOTE Confidence: 0.81755567

65f6b239-15b3-45ec-8013-eb92d48ba3e7
00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:45.319
triangle. Instead of just enable
input, it has Clock, a triangle

NOTE Confidence: 0.81755567

ab7730ff-66e3-4e27-8124-f2d48d4d6211
00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.540
meaning that these

NOTE Confidence: 0.8400806

f164719a-4441-45f7-a79c-885ad763994d
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.476
flip flops are working based on
the positive edge, RS. So just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8400806

837638be-a6aa-4ece-aaea-091d5040eda2
00:02:55.476 --> 00:03:02.592
as a reminder in a RS flip
flop, 00 stores 01 meaning that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8400806

f6410a9e-de45-4e4a-a92e-98c0780c6fc2
00:03:02.592 --> 00:03:09.708
R=1 S=0, reset. S=1 R=0, set.
and 11 is not permitted.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8523722

3d8636d9-38c6-4aee-a8ef-8cf5adbe3e1f
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.768
The D flip flop, again Flip Flop
Zero makes it 0. 1 makes it one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8523722

2cc35a09-b51b-4308-97b6-ecbd6313e5a7
00:03:16.768 --> 00:03:21.575
So basically whatever is in the
input goes inside the flip flop.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80794954

7f2a64b1-011a-40c0-bb0b-fa26e000ef17
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.649
The T flip Flop Zero stores
one compliment, so if the input

NOTE Confidence: 0.80794954

ea1f3722-38bf-4d2c-be16-b709f2b8b888
00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:31.344
is zero, it just stores. But if
the input is one in the T flip

NOTE Confidence: 0.80794954

22499f91-9ec4-44b0-8741-777b85a8622e
00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:34.787
flop, it complements whatever
the current state is. If it is

NOTE Confidence: 0.80794954

3418783b-5276-4272-9cf5-c86c17a382e8
00:03:34.787 --> 00:03:39.795
zero it makes it one. If it is
1, makes it 0 and in the JK flip

NOTE Confidence: 0.80794954

fccac52e-6b06-4508-8999-bf5979e42e97
00:03:39.795 --> 00:03:41.986
flop, we said that this is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8157401

81c9dcde-3216-43e2-8d76-85da35bbc3bc
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.821
a complete flip flop, meaning
that it has all the four

NOTE Confidence: 0.8157401

04113a69-67f0-486c-a390-1c224a77b93b
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:56.535
actions. 00 stores. 01, the K is
the same as they are, so K=1 J=0 or 01

NOTE Confidence: 0.8157401

361ab6cb-49cb-4161-b003-9ad446061e45
00:03:56.535 --> 00:04:03.147
makes it reset. J=1 K=0 makes it set
and 1 1 here is permitted

NOTE Confidence: 0.8157401

a44fe842-12cf-41c0-a512-e4bde5155772
00:04:03.147 --> 00:04:09.759
and makes it compliment. And the
JK comes from Jack Kilby

NOTE Confidence: 0.8157401

c56091ec-e0dd-4ff0-a0c9-b83ee2eca8e9
00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.412
who invented this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8250487

96a128c5-1758-42cd-bd43-dbc0dc4dbe0b
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:13.830
flip flop.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8556449

3c158a1e-402b-4fcf-8c0e-5db79884d556
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.938
For all these flip flops on the
triangle positive edge,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8556449

0960d192-6081-469f-9089-7ac2e5655200
00:04:19.938 --> 00:04:23.994
whenever they want to change the
state, they look at the input

NOTE Confidence: 0.8556449

ba6110ce-2ef1-4f0a-a684-d377766cc10f
00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:28.388
values at the positive edges of
the Clock from zero to 1 and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8556449

dc84daab-a7dc-4d70-81f5-8dfd640d2901
00:04:28.388 --> 00:04:32.782
at that point we see what are the
inputs. If you are given for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8556449

5c6cc937-0310-4871-a197-76c6f5c60b6c
00:04:32.782 --> 00:04:37.514
instance the RS flip flop, what
is going to be the value of R&S

NOTE Confidence: 0.8556449

67e9514d-42fe-4cf4-911b-4514d51deceb
00:04:37.514 --> 00:04:40.556
at the moment that the
transit actually occurs?

NOTE Confidence: 0.82997984

260cb598-ebad-4db9-a339-d0454423c393
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.164
The negative edge is here. We
put a inversion bubble behind

NOTE Confidence: 0.82997984

6f5a78cd-1718-4ffa-ae5c-9101611ee57b
00:04:46.164 --> 00:04:50.278
the triangle, just meaning that
this flip flop is working based

NOTE Confidence: 0.82997984

dad01512-47ea-4c80-b764-c80da5fe0dee
00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:54.392
on the negative edges, and the
negative edges are those edges

NOTE Confidence: 0.82997984

abfb33b8-cfe9-4819-ad45-f5d2c126388e
00:04:54.392 --> 00:04:55.888
that transit from 1 to 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87664336

8649f631-0c0f-4b23-a829-0604621b86de
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.352
And then we said that now that
we have the complete or ideal

NOTE Confidence: 0.87664336

0a784d49-95f5-4446-a93f-d919d48ccf47
00:05:03.352 --> 00:05:08.800
memory unit, a flip flop that is
working perfectly on an edge, by

NOTE Confidence: 0.87664336

fac30c60-8911-4cc9-8f23-79d1937085ac
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.794
default positive edge. So the
next important task is now we

NOTE Confidence: 0.87664336

c4e037f7-f566-4e7a-954b-1252308752d3
00:05:13.794 --> 00:05:18.788
know how to store 1 bit. So
let's make some meaningful

NOTE Confidence: 0.87664336

84198112-1222-46fc-825f-1b591d6b5cd7
00:05:18.788 --> 00:05:22.874
circuits to accomplish some
tasks. So let's build some

NOTE Confidence: 0.87664336

7c75b532-1910-4eba-b97d-4de088634573
00:05:22.874 --> 00:05:27.414
larger memory units or larger
circuits that have memory units.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693051

e48c99cc-3509-4da7-b78a-c5267f3914a6
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.908
So we said that the tasks are
analysis tasks or design tasks,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693051

2d37f30f-b988-4884-9bf4-d8f6d7218753
00:05:32.908 --> 00:05:37.060
the same as in the combinational
logic. So when we introduced

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693051

6d9ad08c-ee15-4048-9717-dc279839a0e8
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.558
the gates in the combinational
logic, you said that now that we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693051

b635661d-2090-46ba-9556-5f4c056a4d1d
00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:46.056
know the gates, the next task is
to build a bigger I mean

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693051

e1211889-b88e-4aa4-9cc2-452633e2179b
00:05:46.056 --> 00:05:50.208
circuit. So we said first is the
analysis. We are given the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693051

cc5ab6d3-089c-4605-a41f-b81a8fe5934a
00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:54.360
circuit and we have to analyze
the behavior. The next task is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693051

8cb86283-d2ba-4772-b992-568a717ad499
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.512
design. So we are given a
problem and we have to design

NOTE Confidence: 0.87888247

afbebe14-d6f4-45c9-aa5a-73dfb3c6b1af
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.994
a circuit for that. The same is
here, so in the analysis we are

NOTE Confidence: 0.87888247

5ed1a9f2-d910-4f0e-8ac0-c60d916fd740
00:06:03.994 --> 00:06:08.240
given a sequential circuit and
we are asked to analyze the

NOTE Confidence: 0.87888247

3c24ab50-c524-4763-873f-57ec68519bb7
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.872
behavior of this circuit. In the
design task, we are given a

NOTE Confidence: 0.87888247

6f13ea32-c7cc-4b3c-b2e2-01f33d01a9eb
00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:17.504
problem and we have to design a
circuit for that problem, and we

NOTE Confidence: 0.87888247

271af695-684a-403c-9922-d00832bbd70f
00:06:17.504 --> 00:06:20.978
solve that problem by sequential
circuit or sequential logic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9294869

9362a572-f584-409e-8c8e-7698284942b2
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.430
So we already said that.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.310
Any sequential logic can be
categorized into three main

d7baad70-e1aa-49fa-acc0-4c28965694b4
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.040
types: those that only have flip
flops, those that have flip

NOTE Confidence: 0.8257784

4d523f42-7180-4e16-8703-249aa57cf343
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.340
flops plus some external
inputs. By inputs I don't mean

c3b1c0d6-915a-4827-ac55-f3ca6e89f916
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.930
the inputs to the flip flop, I
mean inputs that comes from the

c7a7fb13-b76b-40fb-b1c6-66db2a4c9936
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.800
external portion of the sequential
logic and may impact the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8257784

246a3a76-b9c2-4afd-af5b-5a99c543399e
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.960
internal state of the flip flops
or not. We will see this next

NOTE Confidence: 0.8576846

541c5e24-e9d3-4362-b77f-99c4fa4afa10
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.990
lecture. Or flip flops with inputs
and outputs. So as you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8576846

7aead9ac-2031-47a1-9eb7-c5600b09ed37
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.454
see, we make the sequential
logic more complex, but

NOTE Confidence: 0.8576846

bb9a89dc-cfc2-4562-8033-215ce601e346
00:07:03.454 --> 00:07:07.422
instead we have more
capability for the sequential

NOTE Confidence: 0.8576846

95c51e76-6880-479b-bf6e-bc0bfd813b0e
00:07:07.422 --> 00:07:07.918
circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85426664

6cddd421-3fee-49a7-856c-68b5d45fe47d
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.534
So for
the first category, which is only

NOTE Confidence: 0.85426664

c9faa28c-9975-4c77-8b1e-74ab9300e6c6
00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:19.396
flip flop, we started with
the analysis task and then today

NOTE Confidence: 0.85426664

a3417249-ccc5-4f52-8e6b-c20ab00eabe9
00:07:19.396 --> 00:07:25.142
we are going to start with the
design task. So last lecture, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.85426664

5231c515-358e-4d7f-b3ea-805488385e8c
00:07:25.142 --> 00:07:30.004
ran out of time and we couldn't
completely review the analysis

NOTE Confidence: 0.85426664

789de4a3-6add-45ea-ad21-2199584f62de
00:07:30.004 --> 00:07:35.308
task. So today, I'm going to
explain it again by putting more

NOTE Confidence: 0.85426664

1d95290c-d8f6-4552-92d6-39cd013e002b
00:07:35.308 --> 00:07:37.960
focus on it and then we will continue with

NOTE Confidence: 0.88516015

32e16ac9-d823-4f35-8a00-7640a3708245
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.880
the design. So for
the analysis task,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8417365

38221133-8783-4f9e-b8df-10b8b1d47f7b
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:49.355
I'm going to explain with an
example step by step. It's kind of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8417365

79e3b772-1945-4fa7-b43b-bcf4371a2278
00:07:49.355 --> 00:07:51.280
a workshop for the analysis

NOTE Confidence: 0.90843207

da6e03f5-25b1-40ae-bab4-2ead7b1cc647
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.680
task. So basically in the
analysis that you are given this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8999137

34f3790c-590f-4c2c-8093-80117a7891c0
00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.805
circuit. So you are given this
and you're asked to analyze the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8999137

e6427560-7b2b-4c55-8d2b-1c6649376c98
00:08:00.805 --> 00:08:02.265
behavior of this circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9066672

029fe86e-1668-446e-9705-2300ae506cb7
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.918
So the first question
you have to ask yourself is that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9066672

bfb37980-b46d-4f4c-908e-1acda254972d
00:08:07.918 --> 00:08:11.478
is this given circuit
sequential logic or combinational

NOTE Confidence: 0.8274992

0e1a42b8-e3dc-4cf4-91f2-3d965113523a
00:08:11.478 --> 00:08:16.499
logic? So you already knew
how to analyze the combinational

NOTE Confidence: 0.8274992

d51e0154-99fb-4dcb-8ff8-c8e01e722783
00:08:16.499 --> 00:08:21.311
logic in the second and third
chapter. But how can you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8274992

57d2fb55-1448-44f2-9d8c-5e7d2f857497
00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:24.519
distinguish the sequential logic
from the sequential logic?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8274992

af0e9839-7926-4c65-a470-909e8965da8a
00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:28.128
Sorry, the combinational logic
from the sequential logic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8332925

2927048b-0588-4b64-8005-ddee808f85b3
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.100
In order to answer this
question, you just have to look

NOTE Confidence: 0.8332925

c03f3b7e-9974-44a2-b3c9-33046142fe56
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.455
at the circuit and see whether
there is a flip flop or a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8332925

95cc9bd4-796e-4d56-a72c-4fd9f054e312
00:08:37.455 --> 00:08:41.810
feedback. If there is at least
one flip flop or at least one

NOTE Confidence: 0.8332925

d8e0ba42-485a-4ed1-9d89-90358f77a5fa
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:45.160
feedback, it means that you are
dealing with a sequential

NOTE Confidence: 0.8332925

03f5f8f8-d87b-4170-9ca7-11048ee7210b
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.175
circuit. Otherwise you are
dealing with a combinational

NOTE Confidence: 0.92775345

a664118a-f089-49c5-b135-47e10c8a86c4
00:08:48.175 --> 00:08:53.384
circuit. So this way, you can
distinguish different analysis.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8484857

a2709aac-2367-46cd-b602-2d58ea708f73
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:59.310
So by looking at this given
circuit, you see that we are

NOTE Confidence: 0.8484857

e3afa6f1-518e-4910-975c-9c531c9b1372
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.925
given 3 flip flops, not only 1, but 3.
And also we have some feedbacks.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8484857

bea3c71b-a12c-4386-8980-9125d0e02a4d
00:09:03.925 --> 00:09:08.185
The output of the last flip
flop comes to the first flip

NOTE Confidence: 0.8484857

1ae5683d-1a30-4570-9cd8-9eba43c75466
00:09:08.185 --> 00:09:12.090
flop, so these are some
feedbacks. Also the output of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8484857

8687e2fe-65e6-4978-8f0b-d0b9e1808042
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:17.060
T flip flop come back to the RS
flip flop here, so this is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8484857

2ee7b209-7811-47e0-9167-9c0c281c269c
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.255
trivial that the given circuit
is a sequential circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85616076

751f7991-17b8-4922-9277-201b6f77759a
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.554
After that you have to see OK,
now that I know that this

NOTE Confidence: 0.85616076

83d22bef-659f-4d02-a6a2-223217a40308
00:09:26.554 --> 00:09:30.134
circuit we are given is a
sequential circuit, we have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.85616076

7e6348d2-2add-4241-9f45-7a463b6adf62
00:09:30.134 --> 00:09:35.146
see what are the flip flops and
what are the type of types of

NOTE Confidence: 0.85616076

76ed86fc-c793-49d8-bb9c-ad8a29d78198
00:09:35.146 --> 00:09:39.800
flip flops. For each flip flop,
you pick a name. This is very

NOTE Confidence: 0.85616076

e533ae1f-d6e0-4690-9bcd-e7095648debc
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.380
similar to the combinational
circuit. So in the combinational

NOTE Confidence: 0.85616076

c2af95e4-3100-4e0c-9d0d-36ec12257e24
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.676
circuit, you have to see what are
the input binary variables and

NOTE Confidence: 0.85616076

8e590572-75c4-43de-b4dc-e41003fd9d58
00:09:47.676 --> 00:09:51.256
you have to pick a name for them. Here there
are no inputs,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8663973

7dc17154-2dab-45ff-b84d-4af1cb1fad90
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.166
you have flip flops only, so you
have to pick a name for each

NOTE Confidence: 0.8663973

b6ecedb1-cfd0-4b51-b3ae-bf14c3d9e2a5
00:09:55.166 --> 00:09:58.468
flip flop and then you have to
know the type of flip flop.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79403496

1fdfa8c3-6794-420b-8ea4-59b6b306745a
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.520
So. In this circuit, I chose the
first flip flop as A, the second

NOTE Confidence: 0.79403496

d4f4baba-ffbc-428e-855d-e4fedef8d31e
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:12.720
one as B and the last one as C,
and I put a note that the A flip

NOTE Confidence: 0.79403496

27681e1b-c910-4fbf-99a8-cc96b9cd66d3
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:18.320
flop is a JK flip flop. We
already knew what we have

NOTE Confidence: 0.79403496

c2fba133-27fa-4a48-8feb-6eaca1fe9e67
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.720
note them. We have to
recall what are the

NOTE Confidence: 0.79403496

6baca819-a3ec-4e00-8d2e-c842d46c215a
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.720
characteristics of JK flip
flop? For instance 00 stores 01

NOTE Confidence: 0.79403496

0eed5234-8505-487d-b326-b3a7c8237006
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.120
reset. 10 sets and 11 compliments.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8681266

d83272d1-67b9-43bb-b078-22447622cd86
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:34.530
The same is here, so this is the
T flip flop. 0 stores one

NOTE Confidence: 0.8145804

611d8cde-eb64-497a-80b9-d0aad1842245
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:39.220
compliment. And then here the C
flip flop, so we can call

NOTE Confidence: 0.8145804

ebce8670-28d9-4e5e-b601-2e3e3229b030
00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:44.526
them by their name. So
the C Flip Flop is a RS flip

NOTE Confidence: 0.8145804

2b1d273e-49ee-416f-a91b-88f02e8b981e
00:10:44.526 --> 00:10:50.590
flop, so 00 stores. If R is 1, S
is zero, reset. If R

NOTE Confidence: 0.8145804

50552157-06ba-40aa-aafd-af5edd8da801
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:56.275
is 0 and S is 1, set. And if both
are one, it is not permitted.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8145804

c6ee3144-867e-4c30-9a03-43159935a5e8
00:10:56.275 --> 00:11:00.065
So we never expect the R and S to
become one both together.

NOTE Confidence: 0.888305

552b7376-6802-40f9-8564-73f19b50ceb8
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.394
So we pick a name and we know
what are the flip flops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93278587

7bf22d1e-8de1-4038-bf11-fabe004815e3
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.270
And the second step is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89794344

6064efe1-3af7-4e8e-92e5-acea69c46ee7
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.640
We have to see how many
different states this circuit

NOTE Confidence: 0.89794344

7e6e079b-8b39-4dc2-9a7e-6678db68ea77
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.975
actually is gonna produce.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8407421

2c3260e8-90d6-4c37-868b-71caaeb47522
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.732
This is based on the number
of flip flops. We know that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8407421

1e487879-9619-4026-ac09-8c5367c1d5d0
00:11:18.732 --> 00:11:22.208
each flip flop can preserve
either zero or one, so each

NOTE Confidence: 0.8407421

04a061da-5c82-48d9-a561-14458dcc8856
00:11:22.208 --> 00:11:25.368
flip flop is gonna have two
different states, so as you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8407421

82b3b640-252a-4109-b645-d1ce4d8cc1e8
00:11:25.368 --> 00:11:27.264
can see here: zero or one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8845304

c0bbbac7-afa8-475a-b298-39858cb3e58b
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.660
Based on the different states of
a one single flip flop, you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8845304

5e763daf-062f-4051-a033-9168600bbd48
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.310
determine what are going to be
the different combinations

NOTE Confidence: 0.8845304

311844d6-c0ad-4a46-b431-a43ba32ad10a
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.690
in the whole circuit. So
basically 2 to the power of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8845304

254f577d-b026-45e8-b5aa-7c2baf834afb
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:45.070
number of flip flops in the
circuit. So in our example, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8845304

d3f20154-6184-469c-9aaf-7d827b8158be
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.450
are given 3 flip flops. Each one
can have two different states,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8845304

2115e9f9-bb51-4617-bbc2-8921f28e676e
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.830
so in total we're going to have
eight different states in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8845304

6c75f08a-f86c-487b-9fb1-eb49d9cd8978
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.480
whole circuit. 2 to the power of
3 = eight combinations.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88305146

7f976c79-8538-4007-8cd6-d7ddc29d47d7
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:04.777
And then you have to create a
state table. We said that the

NOTE Confidence: 0.88305146

3ce4cb38-af8a-402f-b3bb-3f371279050d
00:12:04.777 --> 00:12:09.421
state table is similar to a truth
table, but not exactly the same.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88305146

da8c0fdb-96cc-42a6-90dc-35ab21c045ad
00:12:09.421 --> 00:12:10.969
So in this table.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8659137

ef582670-d23d-4691-b291-72218d29e8e6
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.890
For each flip flop, we have one
column to show the current state

NOTE Confidence: 0.8659137

1085cc89-fe81-4073-a20d-12686ac01110
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:22.220
or the current value of the flip
flop. One column for the next

NOTE Confidence: 0.8659137

3c35964a-078b-4e1e-95fc-7a67f013ecc5
00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.550
value of the flip flop or next
state of the flip flop. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.8659137

5a4ee3d4-8069-40da-adce-04e7f993b845
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:32.470
basically for each flip flop, we have two
columns, and the number of rows

NOTE Confidence: 0.8659137

ebfbdc2d-ffb4-42e9-aa9e-1b71e493c77a
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.570
depends on the number of
combinations for the states. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.8659137

727f3d58-1dde-418f-a040-7f6f063730cd
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.620
for each combination, we have one row.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8167502

86473946-0949-4f97-a1b4-72badd2e4c3d
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:45.880
So in our example we are given 3
flip flops. The A flip flop for

NOTE Confidence: 0.6483102

b02e950d-c244-4998-a671-fd664a0f5772
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.840
current Q(T). And the next
Q(T+1).

NOTE Confidence: 0.7972536

ab0a293b-af60-43c1-ad2f-73cb1f7ccd8a
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:55.820
There B flip flop has current
value and next value, and the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7972536

72f37338-038b-4f6c-a5b9-2b9ece9900cb
00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.075
C Flip Flop has current value
and next value.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8195658

cbf9200d-fde7-44d8-8d18-94fbfdf16251
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:06.186
Also, the number of rows. As you
can see here the number of rows

NOTE Confidence: 0.8195658

ae4cb318-5d95-41f6-aff2-163a3d5329e0
00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:11.094
is 8 because given 3 flip
flops, we is gonna have eight

NOTE Confidence: 0.8195658

dca9966b-cd95-4dd6-907d-0e97bf6be7cc
00:13:11.094 --> 00:13:14.366
different current states and 8
different next states.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87427175

eb5ad358-bc7a-4c2c-ac5b-51ded3ad772d
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.168
So when we have these states, when
we form the state table, we have

NOTE Confidence: 0.87427175

bee9ace5-13c4-491f-9ef8-913fddc0ae08
00:13:20.168 --> 00:13:24.032
to fill out the state table.
What are the entries in the

00:13:24.032 --> 00:13:28.898
state table? So in order to fill
out this table, you have to for

3bf0f754-2027-4175-bd52-48838f4e7bb2
00:13:28.898 --> 00:13:32.132
the current, you just
put all the different

28cf518b-f944-46b2-8e66-2e56b0241ef6
00:13:32.132 --> 00:13:34.803
combinations or
possibilities. Like the truth

b02a1b5d-24e3-4fba-9012-37f74471b92c
00:13:34.803 --> 00:13:38.412
table, when you put the

d636beaf-674e-44f5-9443-b9899f276b3a
00:13:38.412 --> 00:13:42.422
binary variables. Here we
have flip flops. So you put

64f0cf7f-ae07-4b4a-a89a-bf197cefdd95
00:13:42.422 --> 00:13:45.229
the different possibilities
for the flip flops.

51970e7f-77bc-4760-9202-27ce72c0071e
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.766
And then you have to determine
what's going to be the next

NOTE Confidence: 0.869831

214a0845-baed-41e0-8252-65f8b9b08969
00:13:51.766 --> 00:13:56.242
value or the state of each flip
flop. But remember, when you

b4ea0fa9-7ca2-462d-9125-6ae8291e9fc8
00:13:56.242 --> 00:14:00.718
want to calculate the next
value of the flip flop, you have

NOTE Confidence: 0.869831

b92fe5d6-bd59-4d29-821b-c1e9c96d958b
00:14:00.718 --> 00:14:05.567
to check the current state of
the flip flop and what are the

edad14b9-e194-4bc2-99a9-1a5defcec5f8
00:14:05.567 --> 00:14:07.432
inputs of the flip flop.

7861ed73-5402-412f-a1cf-b588604e004f
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.660
So in the left side, for the
current state, we assume that

NOTE Confidence: 0.84778434

c887a1ff-ef51-4305-8aae-febe8650c2b7
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.495
if they are in the zero state,
all the flip flops are

f7cd4970-4920-446f-8a9a-1aa902a16f64
00:14:16.495 --> 00:14:23.696
zero. What happens if they are
in this state C=0 B=0 A=1?

NOTE Confidence: 0.87890035

6d8a1ff1-d1a4-42a7-a911-292eda039c60
00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:29.281
What happens when the C is 0, B is
1, and A is 0? You can see that these are

NOTE Confidence: 0.87890035

9488a788-078d-4941-a034-8eefca2cfdea
00:14:29.281 --> 00:14:30.789
different possibilities for the

00:14:30.789 --> 00:14:35.012
current state. Very similar to
the truth table for the

27bd1683-6a5e-4e6d-ab18-120fa56805d0
00:14:35.012 --> 00:14:39.320
combinational circuits, and
if we assume that ABC are the

c8b7ebd7-1b0b-4be6-89d1-4e51891fd92b
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.910
input binary variables. But this
is similar, not exactly the

8a8b239d-f2bf-449c-bca8-2fe643476109
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.500
same, because here, ABC are flip

edfda032-af5e-4450-9712-46dd25264bb2
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:53.164
And the next for this, the left
side. For the current state, it is

136da55b-d0c2-40be-9322-0e97b03a8828
00:14:53.164 --> 00:14:57.207
very easy to fill out, but the
right side is important to fill

b2233c8a-3d9f-4c0c-b35f-56f337c7a095
00:14:57.207 --> 00:15:01.872
out. The right side tells what's going
to be the next value of A if the

current value of A is 0.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:09.472
And the value of the input
for the JK flip flop or A matters too,

d3aa62fe-b569-4454-87ed-444fb3d319ff
00:15:09.472 --> 00:15:13.732
so we have to pay attention
to these two items.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93105024

37b46e53-65aa-4d76-9244-372280e311eb
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.179
So let's start.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8581269

4b0db0b2-d661-4f3e-b71d-b212c8460588
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:22.209
So. We want to calculate what's
going to be the next state of A,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8581269

20f7c793-d804-44b3-8cb6-09cf5730d006
00:15:22.209 --> 00:15:24.473
so the current value of A is 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.81381106

76eb9b07-b77a-4db4-8aca-8bce19270637
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.654
What's going to be the next
value of A? And when we say

NOTE Confidence: 0.81381106

6112c0af-db60-4d3c-a550-b13b621f1944
00:15:29.654 --> 00:15:32.910
what's the next value, we mean that
these are the flip flops that

NOTE Confidence: 0.81381106

6bf161f7-3ce0-4c5e-a7db-bc4b1220205b
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.462
are attached to the Clock and these
flip flops are working based on

8f3e6b06-3a65-4e01-bec4-7d994ff9e5cb
00:15:36.462 --> 00:15:39.718
the positive edge, meaning that
when the first positive edge at this

20f4c934-aec6-4229-9858-76b005c59d17
00:15:39.718 --> 00:15:42.678
first transition from zero to
one comes to the Clock,

NOTE Confidence: 0.86425716

fec91b6b-f776-44e5-a69c-d2ac49f63455
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.786
the A changes
from 0 to the 1 value.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7448592

4289dd51-8a3a-44c1-a502-23e0a3423e1c
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.484
So this depends on the current
state and the input of the

e60ce162-e2bc-456f-b471-e49f73614592
00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:57.280
JK. So the current
state of A is 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83727354

f8ede586-db30-4905-9ebd-d8ed5c3ca595
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:06.858
The input, the J input of the
JK Flip Flop or the Flip

b5721135-899b-4687-a641-58b604707f56
00:16:06.858 --> 00:16:09.546
Flop A is attached to the

a3298a77-d63b-4d88-a9a2-f93d462d4181
00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.738
complement of the B flip flop.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7614689

4a531249-120c-4ded-98e6-87450d347f83
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:20.206
So we know that it flip flop has
a Q and Q bar, so this is attached to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7614689

a47f3261-b6e5-47be-9c75-d4214b538ae7
00:16:20.206 --> 00:16:26.003
the Q bar of the B, so Q bar of
the B when we are at the current state.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8707121

085947c3-125b-4580-a6d9-7ea2af30abaf
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:32.222
So assume that currently
the A is zero, B is 0, and C is 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8707121

5e661e9c-c3da-4b12-a6d4-c940e85eca72
00:16:32.222 --> 00:16:36.326
So this is the current state. So
the JK is gonna be

fda7138a-b3e1-4e9f-9263-e2a5cdd6301b
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:42.395
B bar. Q Bar of B at
current of B

4f361f18-c1ac-474c-a723-a67b91db4d67
00:16:42.395 --> 00:16:45.555
is zero followed by
the not becomes one.

5d956443-40c3-4827-9762-710d8d486749
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.092
The K is attached to T. The Q
of the B.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84296834

015f4fde-af17-47b6-8004-4d0b02848c58
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:57.454
So whatever the current state of
B is, it's going to the K, so the K of A

NOTE Confidence: 0.84296834

f7dc5907-31b0-4194-9ea4-0abe549db38e
00:16:57.454 --> 00:17:02.342
is the current state of B, which
is 0. So putting all these

NOTE Confidence: 0.84296834

c0ff66c6-74fb-4155-b1c9-252fda8f6706
00:17:02.342 --> 00:17:07.606
together, the current state is A.
The input of J is 1, the input

d0de10aa-4e3d-4b31-ae76-d2bc49b13537
00:17:07.606 --> 00:17:10.238
of K is 0. This is

c4f5614f-3fa0-44ad-b541-0b0bd6e6c4b6
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:15.356
what action in the JK?

00:17:15.356 --> 00:17:19.748
answer this? So if you have
J=1 K=0 in the input of

695d66ad-836b-4d0e-ad60-2685c9e1f31f
00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:21.212
JK, what's the action?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8375433

c8e88084-768b-4c76-b73d-9dca1a0430fc
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:33.767
Correct, it's set, so we is gonna set. So
we were in the 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85605603

2940fed1-c76f-4ee8-8d2c-91fda5ccb6ea
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.740
And the next step
is gonna be set, so 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9200752

5d23fd39-cda0-41ae-9db8-1c60379e1bdf
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.444
So this is the next value of A.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8443496

5a810898-2210-4f25-89f2-67be1fa61ba9
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.530
After the first positive edge, A
goes to one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8231215

fa26e370-ab7e-44ae-a217-db8dbe4f8dde
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.730
From zero goes to one.

6e8ee086-bb93-47fc-a3f7-21abf7b976a6
00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.050
So this same, we have to do the
same thing for all these cells

NOTE Confidence: 0.91253364

bc5fea16-d22e-429a-9b27-6f20187320a8
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.905
in the right side of the state

00:17:53.905 --> 00:17:59.390
table. So for B. B currently
is zero. So, what's going to be

NOTE Confidence: 0.78997403

6a005a56-c8bf-4d5e-8388-92ab9fe7195c
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:03.070
the next step after the
first positive edge?

NOTE Confidence: 0.91518813

6439132b-81b8-47f3-ac8a-ab5e9f9eb87d
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:08.080
And one thing is that you
have to pay attention to is that

NOTE Confidence: 0.91518813

3372e44e-ddb4-404d-beae-1bfc4578ed7d
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.110
this transition of the B is in

5d6b3566-7e0b-410f-9ecc-fa7c99d45603
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:16.302
parallel with A. So because all
are attached to the same Clock,

NOTE Confidence: 0.88382554

2c5b0938-c10b-4dd2-9739-d10344085785
00:18:16.302 --> 00:18:20.874
so they all simultaneously
transit from one state to

cad91da1-aca3-4ed3-bdc1-fd77182b7b2a
00:18:20.874 --> 00:18:22.398
another state so

e9aca351-ad32-4ef6-ab7a-0085168a24df
00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:28.778
when the A transit from zero to
one, at the same time B is

NOTE Confidence: 0.89068466

5a4d588b-188d-46a0-8ba3-3e7594fd53fd
00:18:28.778 --> 00:18:30.738
transitted from zero to what?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8459622

5fc05a8e-d521-4f97-85fd-14e54439f086
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:35.824
So again. The current
state of B is 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7619644

72ed637e-9154-4aaf-bebc-2c2f68fc0c32
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:42.622
What is the input of T? The
input of the B flip flop which is

1b1e0120-6c56-4765-be50-f90666d6da1a
00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:47.398
of type T, comes from the
output of the C followed by the

00:18:47.398 --> 00:18:52.780
not. So C is currently zero
followed by the not becomes

90bd47db-b846-456a-9135-45f05c024380
00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:58.408
one, so Q of the C flip flop is

9aad537c-e3af-4fe8-8dac-97ce339b180c
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.884
So currently it is zero, followed
by the not becomes one and in

00:19:04.884 --> 00:19:08.646
the T flip flop, when the

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:21.412
So we have T flip flop, the input
of T is 1. What's the action

NOTE Confidence: 0.7264088

05d3fab7-ceca-4493-a674-784d77c55fb3

fe687cc9-aaf4-40a3-9694-aeefa72968d7
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.300
Correct Marco, yes. Q bar
meaning that the compliment so

NOTE Confidence: 0.8228588

60b23e22-44a1-49ea-b623-a27ce21b8df2
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.200
the action in the T flip flop if
the input is one is the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8228588

f0dfbfac-55ab-4d10-8b7b-e03a066992d2
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.950
complement. So here is the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8025043

aab62419-6bf3-4dbf-a16e-fc28a0b834aa
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.533
action. Compliment of
the current state of T,

4ddd5e9f-8c6f-47e2-904f-5609cd37ff72
00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:52.854
current state is 0, so the
compliment is gonna be 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84553146

0607e615-0c2a-4fc8-96a7-c71fd8c10bc8
00:19:54.670 --> 00:20:00.106
So this is the next state, B

NOTE Confidence: 0.858599

a41a2b0f-0f73-4d94-8a91-fe984c44ebf2
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.109
transits from 0 to 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7989565

69785353-abd5-4301-92cf-57f7bf4b98f1
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:09.772
So next is the C, so C is an RS
flip flop, so we have to check

NOTE Confidence: 0.7989565

abb865b6-c9ef-4728-9f54-a8732799b558
00:20:09.772 --> 00:20:14.530
the current state, the input of
R and input of S and see what

3585c3d0-3232-4be4-9dcf-43cbed3cbea0
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.726
happens to the C Flip Flop.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8685548

d5b69f28-21c6-40da-86cb-a6e60b996c46
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.970
The current state is zero, as
you can see here.

f7cd02be-71cc-4805-a4ad-64e662fbe13d
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.740
The current state of C is 0. The
input to the R.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8096793

77b409a7-8c47-4fca-aa84-3c7045e3e6ac
00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:30.736
Let's see the circuit.
R is attached to

f3ed1eab-debc-43fd-a178-0c691f82096c
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.840
the output of A.

3b8f04f2-1274-4ba0-80c8-30b7e378ddf4
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.050
So the Q of A

NOTE Confidence: 0.8236685

4ef2070d-f5e0-4b55-8099-b12a326d4393
00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.296
is attached to the R of the C

NOTE Confidence: 0.8373139

b7e7befb-8a3d-416c-9371-9ffd4a4feb3f
00:20:40.296 --> 00:20:44.980
flip flop.
The current state of A, the

44011166-d4fb-46d6-ac39-cdc6155dcc2c
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.684
current state of A is 0, so zero
goes here and attaches to R.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8708169

69cf5ac3-53df-46df-8f09-6f5c9a034543
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.948
So R of C is 0.

b29299a3-d86d-4026-b5f5-29bf7c35a6e8
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.950
What is attaching to S?

14b0b7d1-fd08-4c5d-9b32-77bfb1b14f75
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.606
The S is attached to the
output of B.

NOTE Confidence: 0.76400304

786d3a4e-62dd-4b39-8888-70e6890372e5
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.400
And B currently is 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80307084

5256b95a-8f11-4a75-89b5-37986837113a
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:09.737
So B is gonna be 0. So R is 0,
S is 0 and we wait for the

NOTE Confidence: 0.80307084

5981e805-42db-435e-a920-bb927bfc16c8
00:21:09.737 --> 00:21:13.616
first positive edge. So when
the first positive edge

NOTE Confidence: 0.80307084

bd1d223f-5342-425d-bbd2-be9657267424
00:21:13.616 --> 00:21:18.357
comes, 00 makes the current
state of C to what state?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9211128

07a10050-b209-435c-a5f6-4ad9b5eb1579

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.620
So if we are given this RS flip
flop, both inputs of the RS are

NOTE Confidence: 0.8495365

f5173c24-9b03-4fd4-9905-7f3e48e624e3
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:34.200
00. Yes, correct Paul. So we're

c160a08e-5ddf-4d51-93be-100a5bf2818e
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.897
current state is 0, so we're
going to store it so, we

4c847797-f053-4002-8030-f260b595ec42
00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:45.656
store 0. And this is
the state, so basically

NOTE Confidence: 0.8591319

33d160d7-87bf-4700-849c-13cb2bcad9e8
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:53.382
when this circuit is in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8591319

bda7fc08-3b67-4794-8d31-fd7fe8f7180b
00:21:53.382 --> 00:21:58.386
edge, it transits to 011. So from
zero goes to 3

NOTE Confidence: 0.84882426

c2d628e1-9e33-4279-add3-c8a3462241f7
00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:00.449
in decimal system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8621029

92f19d93-6b2c-437d-8721-ce5be28258a1
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:06.299
So the same, actually you have
to fill out all the rows in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8621029

96273003-fa99-4611-82db-29d2071aecf8
00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:09.962
the right side the same way.
So one thing is that,

NOTE Confidence: 0.80310637

b4c56071-4cb6-4d30-8478-6456f0ee68ca
00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.992
for simplicity, we could say
that instead of just saying that

NOTE Confidence: 0.80310637

1b526ebc-0edb-4d18-8846-478f90619a37
00:22:15.992 --> 00:22:21.868
Q of the A flip flop at current
T, we could simply summarize

NOTE Confidence: 0.80310637

5e00329e-5ff5-4b35-a350-967adc6d3bff
00:22:21.868 --> 00:22:23.224
this as A.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8539817

6d0c4463-e257-4f9d-81f6-c717409dd485
00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:30.180
And the second output of each
flip flop, the Q bar of A flip

NOTE Confidence: 0.8539817

a79a6175-8ae0-4181-b8bb-0cf97d82aab5
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:35.510
flop at current, we could simply
say that is A bar. So this is just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8539817

97f7b292-f15a-46a4-b842-d1711d000b4b
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:40.430
for simplification, I mean
you could see that this is very

NOTE Confidence: 0.8539817

6206b475-4a81-4e08-ab87-fe5c61eeae8d
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:44.940
similar to the binary variables.
But again, remember we are in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8539817

98880a51-1177-416e-afe0-d28d73cb270c
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:49.450
the sequential logic and these
names are flip flops, not binary

NOTE Confidence: 0.8539817

5f98433a-e217-4dc8-ab32-18caf94b6ad4
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.730
variables. So just for
simplification, instead of just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8539817

54a8495a-42e0-4dc6-9c9c-cf6e18b78ea7
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.370
saying that the current

NOTE Confidence: 0.9089019

4e2e3d01-e780-4167-ac30-45b4ace83244
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.140
state of the A flip flop is A.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6914264

3584d088-43cc-472f-87cc-83c876c2902b
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.058
Or is Q of A at current, we
can simply set A.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8485221

cc4bbeb5-1980-4caa-baca-f8fadbda20ce
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:08.335
Or the not of the current state
of the A flip flop, Q of A at T

NOTE Confidence: 0.8485221

01ab5187-edb2-4f6e-97ee-703d41058763
00:23:08.335 --> 00:23:12.125
not, we could simply input A bar
just for simplification. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.8485221

09454b04-e905-4bff-8de3-273a58acc496
00:23:12.125 --> 00:23:16.294
let's see what happens when we
do this simplification. So for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8485221

2a100fba-c3c3-4c51-ad8b-dabc44743983
00:23:16.294 --> 00:23:21.979
the next state, for the
next row, we are in the 001. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.8485221

0f1ab54e-a73d-4714-9378-b9c1675c8977
00:23:21.979 --> 00:23:25.769
first, we have to see where A transits
to what value?

NOTE Confidence: 0.89497447

9ea9c2ea-c562-42bd-af7f-f02e6a144fae
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.920
So A is 1 currently. So instead
of saying the current

NOTE Confidence: 0.7329986

08fb6655-7048-4f4a-8441-f53226d594c8
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:39.134
state of A, so Q(T) for A is 1, we
can simply say that A is 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9018423

e19eaf2b-1b12-4dce-b919-c04a96a48aab
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.190
So now what's the input to the
J&K?

NOTE Confidence: 0.84802943

6ecfb4db-0fbf-4f76-89af-caf73c13e4a4
00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:53.140
So the J input is attached to
the B flip flop.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7817813

f61c8211-df3c-4f45-a3fe-62b26f5255c4
00:23:54.390 --> 00:24:00.110
And it is attached to the not
output, so B bar.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7479956

d88b0b8c-faef-47c5-80ec-9fe90fd52b81
00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:05.120
B currently is zero, followed
by the not becomes one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.81923425

24171ada-0640-415e-9a53-c812a096baec
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:12.818
Currently 0 not becomes
1. K is attached to the Q

NOTE Confidence: 0.81923425

0d729d0b-9040-4480-ace4-9c59ec676e8e
00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:18.298
output of the flip flop. So
currently, B is 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85792345

c1fc0be1-58c1-4000-a745-3d74af165ae4
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.040
And 0 goes to K of A.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8612089

17fd49ca-002f-46b2-a761-6e2ab0d2e5fd
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:30.150
And when we have J=1 K=0, we are
in the set action. It means that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8612089

c44fd445-cb52-4f94-ac11-d816d523b99a
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.200
whatever the current state is,
we bring a set.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7553446

763c7a01-de30-4c47-b614-c97abfde3585
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.250
We bring it to the set
state, so the current

NOTE Confidence: 0.7553446

ae7102b3-1c45-420d-a976-2e31d0f9bb5e
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.164
is 1 and it goes to one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9096564

073810d2-5c44-49db-9d08-515461d7f9a2
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.847
So let's see what happens to B.

NOTE Confidence: 0.862574

ada8e8fc-6245-4285-b4d6-8de164d91175
00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.908
So B is 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83645856

6a7608d1-f6c4-4384-8ef2-f482884b5b19
00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:56.605
Currently, so again, you can see
that instead of writing Q of B at

NOTE Confidence: 0.83645856

cef218d3-fb3b-4004-8b50-4257971fcb13
00:24:56.605 --> 00:24:59.510
T is 0, I just simply put B as 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.830179

43792208-0aae-46bc-99eb-58f7fa13a161
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.664
And the input to the B flip
flop right now is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8116051

c6321e26-82bb-426b-9eef-ac914a46f004
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:10.826
Q of the RS flip flop here, the C
Flip Flop followed by the not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8116051

041dd82a-11a7-45c2-912b-bd56d1715be0
00:25:10.826 --> 00:25:13.584
Currently, this is zero. C is 0

NOTE Confidence: 0.78878385

cd9db601-ff00-4001-b3e4-4dc6954930f6
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:19.591
followed by not becomes one, so
C bar, which is 1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82834274

b7ba3253-3830-4747-8074-a385f73a2036
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:26.154
And in the T flip flop, one is in
the input means compliment, so the

b98094a7-08a0-4eca-b9fd-0c79aa0fb5ac
00:25:26.154 --> 00:25:28.870
complement action. The current
zero becomes one.

af5cbd69-72da-46f8-bc52-71e935bbfa1f
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.072
The same for the C flip

37070237-aa68-486d-bbe5-9d6341496262
00:25:32.072 --> 00:25:36.072
flop. Currently C is zero, R of C is

f3030b14-5d97-4f5f-89f2-3412dcfdefc6
00:25:36.072 --> 00:25:38.716

7fb23748-e92e-4852-92af-59d774ae9477
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.144
A is currently one,
so one comes here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82123387

05cca506-8025-4f06-9d81-17b53daf3078
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:55.126
S is attached to the output of
the B flip flop and B is

NOTE Confidence: 0.82123387

3388aa59-96e4-470c-9534-2c59fbd946b5
00:25:55.126 --> 00:25:57.884
currently 0. So S of C is

NOTE Confidence: 0.89112395

639a5be6-fcf1-4b74-8fb9-2613aa2ea8c3
00:25:57.884 --> 00:26:04.694
0. And 10, R=1 S=0 in the
RS flip flop means reset.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8156726

aaeb8aa5-4036-46c8-9650-61b8e67158e4
00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:10.070
So reset action goes to 0, so
zero goes to 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9258386

91c56951-49e9-4f57-ac22-7d106f7e071c
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.720
So you have to continue the same
for all the other states, so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8687202

699b251b-e4ef-4fd0-ab62-89977ac47f61
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.969
010 goes to 100

NOTE Confidence: 0.8979798

9ec2ba11-a38f-4f97-8d05-2b1e1cb6b560
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.950
and then 011 goes to,

NOTE Confidence: 0.84611654

c79f49a9-eba2-4ea3-acec-c4b6d4b43422
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:33.620
for A goes to zero, for B goes to
zero, and for C goes to don't care.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84178466

7434d570-205b-45d5-862b-9f0a0cae9af8
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.008
Or an indeterminate state. And
the reason is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9267348

d5713bb5-58b4-4a53-8388-d9204d84aa9c
00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:39.978
Why does this happens?

NOTE Confidence: 0.84805495

052cb798-e303-4a5c-a89e-b8f3abed14a8
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.450
R is attached to A

NOTE Confidence: 0.8935539

d4e3fb00-4fb0-455b-916b-3362d1294bbc
00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.090
Which is currently one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8715302

0b5a5641-0a31-4c80-a599-38472f64cebd
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:56.820
OK. Also, S is attached to
B, which is currently one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89482987

3630310a-b3dd-4f11-8304-4a14f18010f1
00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.799
So 11 in the input of the RS.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80121773

46401423-2334-48df-9191-cf0c92dba48c
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:07.369
The C Flip flop
is zero. Both inputs are 11,

NOTE Confidence: 0.80121773

44696cc0-cc80-4d42-ae97-c16d3b9b316d
00:27:07.369 --> 00:27:12.731
so this is not permitted.
And if you have 11 in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.80121773

2a748f56-fa2d-48ef-95bd-4f74cc69858c
00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:15.795
RS, it brings it to the
indeterminate state.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9356394

0597e721-fe3a-424a-937b-4108419f7a0c
00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.438
So that's the reason.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8819232

3afdccd1-42c3-417d-8ce0-9bdbe2031c43
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:24.731
And again you continue this way.
If you are given 100, what's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8819232

b0b65b6f-5e27-4667-8b6b-722083915d2a
00:27:24.731 --> 00:27:27.587
going to be the next? It is going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.89139295

ae362bee-ca5a-438e-ac16-dc3f98aa7199
00:27:27.587 --> 00:27:31.696
be 5 or 101. If you're at five, you
are going to one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8774914

d3926b39-2705-40fc-ab7a-00e51c9d93fe
00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:37.702
If you're at 6 or 110, which transits
at the next positive edge, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8774914

f2042762-69f9-436c-b3f5-598c2aa4e9ac
00:27:37.702 --> 00:27:40.789
transit to the 010, which is 2.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85993725

01fb9717-a146-47ac-a90c-9e1f3b6c16fb
00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:46.860
And then if you are given
the seventh state, we go to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.85993725

8a981b10-e4cc-48fb-88bf-22992fae7301
00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.930
again, to the indeterminate state
for C and 10 for A and B.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8861299

fc794772-8c4b-41e5-b35f-7e41d5ede426
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.873
So this way we fill out the
state table, and after the state

NOTE Confidence: 0.8861299

b307c83d-14e3-4b2e-82dd-02e2b4de19ab
00:27:57.873 --> 00:28:02.046
table, by looking at the state table,
you can simply say

NOTE Confidence: 0.8861299

e3165363-1d9a-475a-856d-7c287c8d6671
00:28:02.046 --> 00:28:06.540
that if you are at zero, you go
to three. If you are at

NOTE Confidence: 0.85806525

3e6e6d99-2b26-41b5-a639-a392da3658bf
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:10.697
one, you go to three, and etc.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8870641

76e48f54-c193-47bb-89ba-d3bfe6182e19
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:13.979
So either you can see
in the decimal system

NOTE Confidence: 0.8870641

96c83006-0a80-4215-b4ca-0c246c67da88
00:28:13.979 --> 00:28:15.384
or in the binary system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8822256

0658874d-7e0d-4ec0-bd7f-a7d9599762ae
00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:20.610
And based on this transition,
you can create another diagram

NOTE Confidence: 0.8822256

95378a3e-7569-4e01-b097-499bb3130081
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.237
which is called a state
transition diagram. You already

NOTE Confidence: 0.8822256

e6490aea-c47f-408a-8312-e1ca592aacde
00:28:24.237 --> 00:28:28.267
saw this state transition
diagram for the flip

NOTE Confidence: 0.8822256

c041952d-4e46-4055-9cef-46633d530088
00:28:28.267 --> 00:28:32.297
flops just to study the life
cycle of flip flops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86964154

f05f5bea-78d6-4f33-a87d-cec2be336dc9
00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:37.380
Here we can do the same for
larger circuits, sequential

NOTE Confidence: 0.86964154

ef9b02e0-7dec-421a-8437-52953334bb08
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.620
circuits. So basically for each
state you create a node,

NOTE Confidence: 0.86749244

6ced7c51-89f7-418f-8fd0-bad819d745cc
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:48.638
and from one state or one node
to another state, you create a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8871285

a99ff9e1-e38f-41d5-a9a2-8d5f056112aa
00:28:48.638 --> 00:28:53.208
directed edge. So for this
example, basically this becomes

NOTE Confidence: 0.8871285

5b2e5722-c6fc-4d88-bc06-08dc4167319f
00:28:53.208 --> 00:28:58.092
the transition state
diagram. So as you can see in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8871285

87f12cc8-799a-44fd-b5bb-aa7c016b02af
00:28:58.092 --> 00:29:00.312
the state table from zero.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89030826

5a22ad05-10c0-4850-9b96-7f206cf9c6ba
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.610
000, you transit to the 011.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8614204

d84b522c-2c86-4beb-9978-4e662df8358e
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:10.260
So in the state transition
diagram zero or 000 transits

NOTE Confidence: 0.9164192

117a7657-5801-4ac7-9577-cc183bfb4a1c
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.290
to 011,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8147973

9927731d-5ebd-4b44-a9d4-24bc8c6381f8
00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:17.488
so basically each row is gonna have
its own node.

NOTE Confidence: 0.912934

a1245cac-86cf-43c6-ab22-2881de01083f
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.921
And the edges are the
transition from each state

NOTE Confidence: 0.912934

ee0f0f5c-0602-4cdf-b281-21e3af40adab
00:29:21.921 --> 00:29:23.118
to another state.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:32.916
So again from 1 or 001, you transit
to three. So let's see from

6b0fc2d4-ac02-413b-9a2b-167c23c0f503
00:29:32.916 --> 00:29:35.508
1 or 001, you transit to 3 or 011.

b3f56dad-365c-4dd5-a349-3d2bccf5acea
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:42.834
Also, for instance, from
5 or 101, you transit to 1 or 001.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8852179

c72b7ae9-6f18-41ee-b533-4714a73b4d8e
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:49.825
So let's see for the
5. Here is the 5 or 101.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8852179

4b050c1f-d1f7-424d-b9c0-efcfbed766ab
00:29:49.825 --> 00:29:51.970
You transit to 1 or 001.

87753546-77ec-42e9-a5ae-4c77a0df834b
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:59.192
There are two states that
transit to the indeterminate

00:29:59.192 --> 00:30:05.365
state: three and seven, because
in these two states, the C

7eb0fcef-b75e-4b4c-931f-14bfa3038d4f
00:30:05.365 --> 00:30:07.690
flip flop goes to the

d39330b3-ea51-41f0-aae5-d896d71ed768
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:11.630
indeterminate state. So in the
state table as you can see here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84900993

5cd3da33-59f8-46e8-993a-20728ab060b2
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:17.740
If you are at 011, the C flip
flip flop goes to

NOTE Confidence: 0.84900993

ec07faba-5add-4da0-81a4-6734152b7b58
00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.330
the indeterminate state.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8538398

1528cdd0-d574-4846-8fcc-9ff80b7c7dba
00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.425
Also, when we are at the 7.

dd98bd34-2f53-48c1-8875-a70df321c682
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:29.633
So in this state transition, you
see that from three and seven we

84390f51-3012-4acd-96ff-ba27c6e053a4
00:30:29.633 --> 00:30:31.638
go to a indeterminate state.

d9707728-59cb-4c87-9b14-afefd0ebf4b4
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:39.727
And we're done. But the thing
is, you can do another

optional step, meaning that

So that circuit, that

00:30:55.176 --> 00:30:59.884
acts like this. From zero at
the first positive edge goes

to improve this sequential

with the circuit in order to
solve the issue.

0ebad204-2ddb-4de1-a5fc-2062f6c61e39
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:23.216
Or you can ask some questions,
what is the longest life

0ceb4480-fe1c-444f-b802-c3906c3551ae
00:32:23.216 --> 00:32:28.808
cycle of the circuit? This is
the longest life cycle. So if

821df084-4380-4fa6-8c02-a3b52db63080
00:32:28.808 --> 00:32:34.400
you start from here 123456. So
after 6 positive edges it goes

fcfe21e3-b720-4ad8-9794-c8cabdb00bdd
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.264
to the indeterminate state.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:42.485
And one thing is that, you could
ask is it possible to get rid of

cb1c3ebb-7ac8-499d-a3c5-618d73b9de9e
00:32:42.485 --> 00:32:45.972
this state? Is it possible to
transit from this state to

00:32:45.972 --> 00:32:51.122
another state? The answer here
is no, and the reason is if you

NOTE Confidence: 0.91241586

f1ccea1a-192e-4d0b-ad90-f54d8fa6c93e
00:32:51.122 --> 00:32:53.174
go back to the state table,

97ee14e3-1245-4d58-aa67-1bd2fd2103a7
00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:59.790
in the left side, you don't have
any current state like this.

28be587c-a063-467f-a7ec-783d9d67dd84
00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:05.710
So in the left side, you
see don't care 00 in order to

62bf0e0a-d287-479c-9ee7-6cf55d93538d

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.556
And here's the recap before your
questions. I'm just doing a recap. So

061480f9-5c94-4caa-afcd-05556c88be12
00:33:29.556 --> 00:33:33.604
firstly, you have to see the
given circuit for the analysis.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86693126

a5b91cec-fdb9-4bfb-b036-b3e3db89cc4c
00:33:33.604 --> 00:33:36.548
The given circuit is
sequential or combinational.

NOTE Confidence: 0.878707

5191ef92-e1b8-4169-b4df-e4ebaaaf0007
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.936
If you see one flip flop at
least or a feedback, it is

0f71abe3-e30f-4f75-8142-1cfbfbb9b7af
00:33:41.936 --> 00:33:43.344
sequential. Otherwise is
combinational.

68e9d4cf-2c97-404f-8132-f20071f6d154
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.401
Then you start your analysis. For
the sequential circuit, you have

cd4b9009-ab3b-43d8-87d9-69bf15a195f5
00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:52.613
to see what are the
flip flops. So basically they

19dd8f4a-5172-41f5-834e-cf8e444ba015
00:33:52.613 --> 00:33:56.825
are either RS, D, T, JK
or a mix of each other. For

00:33:58.931 --> 00:34:04.614
etc. And then you have to pick a
name for them. So A B C X Y Z,

1b1dab2f-0779-4543-a540-b3353c3ddb16
00:34:04.614 --> 00:34:08.910
whatever naming you prefer, you
have to pick a name for each

00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:11.058
flip flop. Flip flop. Flip flops.

111975d3-6e26-45c4-bd25-f212fc53fdd8
00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.716
And then you have to see what
are the number of different

fd50c799-837d-45c9-b8c3-c1af83111db1
00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:24.527
This is basically based on this
formula, so if you are given N

00:34:24.527 --> 00:34:29.631
flip flops, you have to just
make it a power of two. So 2 to the

f61a3c23-6caa-4cac-ad8f-ed9f8ed955ae
00:34:29.631 --> 00:34:33.140
power of number of
flip flops actually gives you

9ab0de1a-41b2-4ec7-9f39-b69d2619fe0c
00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.416
the number of combinations.

741ae8b4-a32f-4bab-b0e5-433c81ec526c
00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:41.611
And after that, you have to form
this state table. The state table for

each flip flip flip flops.
Actually, uh oh my god, I cannot

0876c6ab-3f89-4117-b477-3461ba4fe09c
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:57.946
For each memory unit, you have to
create one column for current

c459896a-86ef-41bb-82ec-59fc6eb491e6

00:35:00.184 --> 00:35:06.430
state. And then you have to form
rows in the total

07f7dae3-076d-4ad3-b157-a6daea72aaaf
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:07.750

ffe1d2bc-e4a7-4cdf-be97-7c21847cc037
00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:16.160
And then after that you have to
fill out the state table. As I

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:42.530
Yes, but sometimes we can
simplify that. Sometimes we said

ed0c17e1-8d83-49dd-888a-fb045fb953a8
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:46.919
that this is the sequential

00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:56.600
form. Or we could say that we
could give you the state table

e82dd391-4c10-44d3-a93d-8ffd7b5fac25
00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:03.480
and we ask you just to fill

given circuit, so we can
simplify the whole process, but

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:12.825
sometimes, at least one
question is gonna be regarding the

whole steps. So basically you
are given a sequential circuit.

00:37:21.725 --> 00:37:26.175
combinational. So, it's easy.
You already know how to analyze

fab7c9f8-2362-4869-8524-40081bfd5024
00:37:26.175 --> 00:37:28.400
it, but mostly I mean,

9886228f-f184-4c21-b05e-b74a532ddd56
00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:33.426
the given circuit is sequential
and you have to do all these

cc97b2ef-dd71-4e12-85d5-aa9f5afb8319
00:37:33.426 --> 00:37:38.262
steps. So the most important
part is the state table and the

4d3dc485-67b7-4a06-9af9-d5e5111fb0d7
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.660
the analysis. Any other

00:38:23.686 --> 00:38:24.808
on these steps.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9057802

279918b8-b4f9-4c7d-9222-d60834256633
00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:30.380
So imagine we are given this
problem. We want to

NOTE Confidence: 0.87556773

ea381f35-6c48-4dac-bbaf-5752429db90b
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:37.940
design a circuit that does
counting from zero to N.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87017936

b8e64d70-b12e-4cda-9709-09374f417779
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.941
012345 up until

NOTE Confidence: 0.9048588

6e070e7f-776e-4cd8-ae43-43bf5dacd02a
00:38:41.941 --> 00:38:46.740
N. So you might ask, what's
the usage of this circuit?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8617261

e13df513-fe87-4739-a099-eba38c154695
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:53.147
Yyou remember once I said
that instead of just multiplying

NOTE Confidence: 0.8617261

75c74b27-9eca-4d60-a7ae-65a33b7ff2c2
00:38:53.147 --> 00:38:58.394
in the combinational logic, you
can do addition multiple times.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8617261

496dc0ca-033d-4cff-8aba-41b06f89c59b
00:38:58.394 --> 00:39:04.118
For instance, 2 * 5 is equal to
adding two five times.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9011828

08522278-e6a7-40e5-b53d-7b0d28c47484
00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.585
So another way to do
multiplication is addition a

NOTE Confidence: 0.9011828

72e811ac-2cd7-48c9-b42e-cb98cfd7b47b
00:39:08.585 --> 00:39:13.040
number of times. So if you
build a counter, you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9011828

35d1dcb1-38b4-4a5a-bcc2-fdfe1e949a44
00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.685
count the number of additions
and then do the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9011828

490f5e26-9c11-4bd0-8d6a-a722ebf913f4
00:39:16.685 --> 00:39:19.115
multiplication. So this is 1
usage.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8330202

3c26f8ab-af67-481d-8e09-1ca972e903df
00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:24.176
There are different uses for
that. For instance, sometimes

NOTE Confidence: 0.8330202

ac684ad9-15dc-40f5-9278-dace38df0220
00:39:24.176 --> 00:39:25.952
you need

NOTE Confidence: 0.81168044

5aaca1a6-80e4-4766-81ed-853de1968341
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:32.397
just a specific amount of Clock
pulses. For instance, you wanna

NOTE Confidence: 0.81168044

16da5556-9ffa-49ed-9c93-921f3764c491
00:39:32.397 --> 00:39:37.881
do a task which needs only 10
pulses, positive edges. So by

NOTE Confidence: 0.81168044

88a32a88-f67d-4f07-a4c8-bd47f80890a3
00:39:37.881 --> 00:39:42.451
counter, you can attach your
counter with the original Clock

NOTE Confidence: 0.81168044

771823d3-3cb0-4bcd-9fb7-8efc96f0c150
00:39:42.451 --> 00:39:47.935
in the system and you start
counting up until for instance 10,

NOTE Confidence: 0.81168044

e8a0422b-5c9c-455a-bb68-61fa360dbd63
00:39:47.935 --> 00:39:54.333
and after 10 you stop. You make
an end on the Clock, and you always

NOTE Confidence: 0.81168044

e99ec9e3-e2cc-4843-9e4b-36c50c07f31f
00:39:54.333 --> 00:39:58.446
generate zero for the Clock. So
basically if you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8020311

82a17214-76e8-4609-8382-2fa83be2fe42
00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.250
attached a counter with the clock,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8869958

81074044-1889-48c8-bf8b-6e538b686c91
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:04.171
you can count the number of
pulses and stop whenever you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8869958

f7ead8be-c823-40d3-82bf-6a8ed0fcc5c4
00:40:04.171 --> 00:40:05.726
want to stop your counter.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8778727

d7ee2d6b-bc66-453e-a5de-ac3af9fbc427
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.715
So this is another usage
of that. So let's see how

NOTE Confidence: 0.8778727

6b4b6690-a9f0-4791-98f7-337508e99e9c
00:40:09.715 --> 00:40:11.240
can we design a counter.

9530433e-b7f9-4b4e-a662-28ac52037ac0
00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:17.330
The first step, actually, as I
said, the zero phase is that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8722964

eb69a59b-3ec8-4297-90e0-1182f63c956b
00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.380
are we going to design
a combinational circuit

NOTE Confidence: 0.8722964

23a7f5a4-b1e6-4acf-86ee-3ce41ebb2bad
00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.670
or a sequential circuit?

NOTE Confidence: 0.87343436

47cc1772-a398-41db-add3-68f6a2c1d67f
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:29.344
So the same, the similar question
with the analysis. Are we

NOTE Confidence: 0.87343436

81c4cc44-216c-402f-89d9-ad385b64c581
00:40:29.344 --> 00:40:32.320
dealing with the sequential
circuit or combination circuit?

NOTE Confidence: 0.904343

00dc194b-fc0b-4c00-b209-66ca1ba05035
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:37.530
The thing is, when you are in
the design task, you have to ask

NOTE Confidence: 0.904343

cd0a08b2-b2bf-4d0d-bfb4-9081ed61f501
00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:38.810
this question from yourself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8937133

a7213124-705a-4297-a76d-96275542da2a
00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:41.270
Do we need memory units?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8874062

48391f6f-a9c9-48db-81bf-bc0a3cd86756
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:46.766
As long as you need a memory
unit, you are dealing with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8874062

9cdb3833-319f-4921-8d8d-f08872186a9f
00:40:46.766 --> 00:40:50.393
designing a sequential circuit.
Otherwise you don't need to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8874062

063cd18e-c491-49eb-b3b2-531c3cb6d7ce
00:40:50.393 --> 00:40:54.423
design a sequential circuit. You
are dealing with a combinational

NOTE Confidence: 0.8874062

a51e1703-4e55-4f9d-a1d4-275340cae23d
00:40:54.423 --> 00:40:58.453
circuit as we did for the
combinational logic chapters.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9130394

2b924f36-5f9c-4b4e-bbd5-60cff0e490ca
00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.960
So let's see if this problem needs
memory or not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.869027

8c654ce4-e1d9-4fe4-9e8b-580a435fe967
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:08.980
So counting from zero to
N means that 0 to 1 to 2 to 3 up

NOTE Confidence: 0.869027

e9d7819e-29ec-40b2-8840-3e7e562a9474
00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.986
until N - 1 and then N.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8984512

152a7aec-9f23-4681-bba0-93a75a6bc133
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:16.627
The thing is, whenever we do
counting, this is trivial, but

NOTE Confidence: 0.8984512

b69bead8-91b2-451a-a295-8f9e793091ce
00:41:16.627 --> 00:41:20.748
you have to think about that
if you want to count to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8984512

2cd17583-435b-441e-b943-4de0ea6ad190
00:41:20.748 --> 00:41:24.552
N, you have to store your
previous number in order to go

NOTE Confidence: 0.8984512

3c575f2a-fd82-44fc-bdc0-ce6c8c874bcd
00:41:24.552 --> 00:41:28.673
to the next number. So for
instance, if you want to go to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8984512

5e291376-87ff-43d5-a5bf-99bc17d93d97
00:41:28.673 --> 00:41:32.794
two, you have to see if
whether you are in one or not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8984512

f60d24ef-3d89-45cf-baa8-26d0a79bdda0
00:41:32.794 --> 00:41:38.500
If you are in one, you can go to
two, but if you are in 0, you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9192673

6d4d6165-eb7c-4a1a-8967-64babc57b647
00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:43.714
go to one. So at each time you
have to see what's the current

NOTE Confidence: 0.9192673

ce479f7d-3d2c-4e97-a475-e61f532562ec
00:41:43.714 --> 00:41:47.242
number in order to see what's
going to be the next number.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8888602

30f019dd-1a9b-4274-afa0-5b306c325404
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:55.138
So this implies that you need
a storage to store the current

NOTE Confidence: 0.8643381

03131399-134a-4057-8278-eaa8af2c7ddf
00:41:55.138 --> 00:41:59.179
number. By storing the current
number, you know what's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8643381

1897a7bf-0c2e-45d2-a596-e568f7639614
00:41:59.179 --> 00:42:02.671
going to be the next number. If
you don't store the current

NOTE Confidence: 0.8643381

9144b215-765e-4fbe-bcbf-46fdf6ec959e
00:42:02.671 --> 00:42:06.454
number, you don't know from what
number you wanna go to the next

NOTE Confidence: 0.8643381

df96ea54-a63f-4f8d-adf8-0cbc2e04a0ed
00:42:06.454 --> 00:42:10.237
time. You know you have to count,
you have to increment by one,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8643381

c1d40776-1d85-49c6-ae4f-6debe6e60055
00:42:10.237 --> 00:42:13.438
but you don't know where to add that
one to what number?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8544907

85cf9673-8703-4d5f-bfc9-cd7229ee51fd
00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:19.589
So. You need a storage to store
the current number. This means

NOTE Confidence: 0.8544907

aee1ab64-2288-48d1-b29a-f7560e77d002
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:22.910
that you are dealing with
designing a sequential circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8689755

01ba7107-89b6-4dcc-91ae-a08a99b06c54
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.510
Whenever you need the storage
memory, it means that you need

NOTE Confidence: 0.8689755

8044ad73-395a-4ecb-9a8d-3147746d66c1
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:31.180
flip flops or
memory units and you are

NOTE Confidence: 0.8689755

a6e5144e-34f0-499a-830c-1dca94445b79
00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.015
dealing with a sequential
circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.864598

8d55bc57-fbb6-4f40-b096-d2e3890a5ecd
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:39.633
So the first question was this.
So that was the sequential

NOTE Confidence: 0.864598

3bdae16c-2b8b-46e9-9272-36000c34c544
00:42:39.633 --> 00:42:43.963
circuit because we need the
storage. So the next question

NOTE Confidence: 0.864598

43034e33-ca6b-47e1-902e-69944491da04
00:42:43.963 --> 00:42:49.159
is going to be this. Now that we
need storage, how much storage

NOTE Confidence: 0.87063515

15199546-eabf-45bf-8c14-8f694996121d
00:42:49.159 --> 00:42:55.746
units do we need? We knew that we can store
1 binary bits, a zero or

NOTE Confidence: 0.87063515

ef708283-fcee-40a8-8b0a-44862124235a
00:42:55.746 --> 00:43:01.281
one in flip flops, so
the the next question is that if

NOTE Confidence: 0.87063515

9d2314aa-1963-49d7-b96b-66e62bb81d6b
00:43:01.281 --> 00:43:06.078
you need storage, how much
storage? When we say how many in

NOTE Confidence: 0.87063515

8ebcf5bb-0e50-459c-a8f2-c1fbdbf0b911
00:43:06.078 --> 00:43:10.137
a binary system when a binary
computer system we are dealing

NOTE Confidence: 0.87063515

b89e6f2e-098c-4b42-aaaf-cea681586701
00:43:10.137 --> 00:43:15.303
with the number of digits. So
you have to see when you want to

NOTE Confidence: 0.87063515

bcb9c42a-7cbc-4109-80b2-daa933113e77
00:43:15.303 --> 00:43:19.362
store the current state or the
current number. In our example,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87063515

c8b0d282-7e81-426b-9c60-9b1c58e09988
00:43:19.362 --> 00:43:23.052
what's going to be the current
number in binary system?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7356942

2ae9bad2-8ea7-4025-8447-bd7d567e3b02
00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.535
How many binary digit current state
that is gonna have?

NOTE Confidence: 0.88755137

f7e7de3c-a0db-4b2c-bcde-87ade2819f70
00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:35.220
So in our example, if N is
equal to 7, meaning that we want

NOTE Confidence: 0.88755137

6307f343-ac33-4237-8d0a-bfdf28d816ef
00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:38.340
to count from zero to 7 ,1234567.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8721728

7e256550-e0ed-4edc-a396-96aab358899e
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:43.383
If you transfer these numbers,
decimal numbers to binary

NOTE Confidence: 0.8721728

4afb853e-37b7-4c9c-b137-c0331550eebd
00:43:43.383 --> 00:43:49.324
system, it becomes 000 goes to 001
goes to 010 and etc. So because the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8721728

01bee3b0-bdb7-43c5-bb86-359d90143ea6
00:43:49.324 --> 00:43:54.351
maximum number in the counter is
7 for representing seven, we

1f66f73f-e810-4e3d-b62e-96e26b1d9519
00:43:54.351 --> 00:43:55.722
need 3 bits.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8250369

55e6c93e-273d-405a-acca-afa922cfd898
00:43:56.790 --> 00:44:01.201
3 bits means 3 flip flops
because each flip flops can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8250369

59a19fdb-38bc-4f0e-acc4-27d37c65a57a
00:44:01.201 --> 00:44:06.013
store 1 bit. So now we know how
many storage we need.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80668473

dc61f164-02e7-4cd8-bae8-b5e4eaa82567
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.832
So we need a storage. We need
3 bits to store 3 bits,

NOTE Confidence: 0.80668473

868c50bb-8187-4dc9-b330-d07f8caa251e
00:44:12.832 --> 00:44:16.042
so we need 3 flip flops. The
next state is.

b9e25051-3c90-4d7f-80f3-cc55dfbe3fb5
00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.200
from the state table.

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:38.540
So this is very similar to the
analysis task. So basically each

6672335d-7eac-4d14-8411-874a6aa1266d
00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:42.460
state is gonna have one note an
from one state to the next step.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86559355

70bbee99-8700-44ed-9ce5-a25902de7fab
00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.140
We're going to have a directed

NOTE Confidence: 0.8600164

abf05741-de69-4621-8540-b9a35eed0349
00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:48.640
edge. Here, each state is the
current number. Next state is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8600164

489cc9c7-4bb2-4deb-90ee-7787754c60bf
00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.656
the next number in this example.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8889018

da952e1d-bc7e-4993-9bd7-0b3610871a76
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:57.320
So. From zero we want to go to 1
from 1, one to go to two.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8216788

2de49556-56f4-4b16-a7b8-a1412e8b6373
00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:05.730
then 3 then four, then five,
then six, and then finally 7.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8950578

85db14c2-e513-4305-ba7f-7bd3e6e0bfd1
00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:11.290
What happens after 7? So
basically based on our problem

NOTE Confidence: 0.8950578

a75e9c07-766c-433d-bc82-0258bbf6dede
00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:15.982
definition, they say that we
want to count from zero to 7,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8950578

d84724bc-ae6b-486e-b6cf-db5dfbcd1150
00:45:15.982 --> 00:45:18.719
but it doesn't say after 7, what

NOTE Confidence: 0.88317513

c05c3561-dc6f-4abd-b9e1-df49b141a660
00:45:18.719 --> 00:45:24.420
happens? So this is a design
choice, so because the problem

NOTE Confidence: 0.88317513

570117b6-df4f-4845-817c-4cd29e783606
00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:30.075
is ambiguous or vague in this
state, we can decide where to go

NOTE Confidence: 0.88317513

d62d90cd-be77-41da-8e51-3e2f6f0f4d51
00:45:30.075 --> 00:45:34.860
from 7. So what would be your
design choice in this?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8725173

ebad84b9-cb09-41c5-b20d-af3ca46aa673
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:40.686
The transition diagram so from
7. How do you fix this problem?

NOTE Confidence: 0.83558

e84ea35b-2570-40c2-98b5-8c9a9db64f07
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:47.520
Off Marco says, back to 0 this
is 1 design option so we can we

NOTE Confidence: 0.83558

d9840466-9871-4bdb-a17f-6e9f62ec20d3
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.620
come back from 7 to 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.94209033

5aed77f0-9650-439c-badc-accaf5f999ba
00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.610
Is there any other option?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7973372

325127f6-6c1e-44c6-9e9c-0657648da6e8
00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:57.657
Oh Nonika says store 7 
Store 7. You're right, meaning

NOTE Confidence: 0.7973372

37e77aaa-24f9-496f-ba26-7e79618ff05a
00:45:57.657 --> 00:46:02.712
that it stay at 7, so from zero
to 7 and then stay as seven

NOTE Confidence: 0.8511089

630dd6f2-cb0b-4326-90fe-89a908bdf530
00:46:02.712 --> 00:46:07.250
forever. So these are two
options. You could say that from

NOTE Confidence: 0.8511089

c43440d4-6fda-4ee3-8af3-d718a1da47f8
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:13.058
7 I'll go to two from 7. I go to
five, but two meaningful fix to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8511089

31ce2472-fbac-43eb-b773-3932203cb5d1
00:46:13.058 --> 00:46:17.414
the problem. Gonna be as the
Marco says. and Nonika says one

NOTE Confidence: 0.8511089

1f0cacee-804d-4a20-bfbd-04fda1bc7355
00:46:17.414 --> 00:46:19.955
of them is from 7 to 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8833731

e84bda85-44bb-43f6-9612-fefbae14c2f5
00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:27.436
Which means that loop, so we do
counting forever from zero 1 2 7

NOTE Confidence: 0.8833731

679f4f57-a759-420f-9ebc-fe9f93142c16
00:46:27.436 --> 00:46:32.008
and then again 7127. So
basically we do counting

NOTE Confidence: 0.84076184

6b87d8df-27cc-4a47-981e-e415aa4327d1
00:46:32.008 --> 00:46:38.580
forever. Or as Nonika
says, we can say that from 7 we

NOTE Confidence: 0.84076184

f8fbd5e1-70ed-4f02-ac79-42b0f3680100
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:43.156
stay at 7, so we just one time
count and then stay here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86807233

b3e151e9-8a0a-4783-b3bd-48b8e6c45bdf
00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.958
OK. So one time counter.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87542695

239ba90f-7acd-43ce-b6d3-6e5e265c5d54
00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.730
And this one loop forever.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8890897

e40fb7a2-5bd4-4043-bf11-d3e339460f45
00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:55.604
So these are two options. We
continue with this one, but for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8890897

b0d0de7b-048d-40ea-bae9-d190b9b24a70
00:46:55.604 --> 00:47:00.488
the new next slide I'm going to
explain the two options so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87815

7a0f77b9-2aaa-4048-971f-e77b2a7d5d54
00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.044
After the we now we know that we
are dealing with the sequential

NOTE Confidence: 0.87815

af302ad6-eec9-4368-ac20-b1ddcd883045
00:47:05.044 --> 00:47:06.584
circuit because we need the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8389996

31ebf6fa-b61f-404b-9f42-3d44df1ff415
00:47:06.584 --> 00:47:10.790
memory. We know how many memory
we need based basically it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8389996

4714907f-69b3-4205-8952-204ff81da2c1
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:14.690
number is gonna have 3 bit. So
we need 3 memory in it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8557507

c132b803-b007-4000-977e-06ed0d00445f
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.589
And then after three memory
units, we know from what is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8557507

10ebf771-a6fa-4f40-9b23-c6d1abaa06f5
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:21.937
said, we is gonna translate to what
is that based on this diagram.

NOTE Confidence: 0.882439

a6ca06c8-79ad-4d76-af7c-774eae2616a2
00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:26.323
And the next state. The next
step is the.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85240287

1bc1d8db-fc9a-443e-842e-29adaf5e1b87
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:31.870
State table. So this is the
reverse of the analysis. Kind of

NOTE Confidence: 0.85240287

547f09c3-0b96-4f3e-afd5-477fe30247b5
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:34.201
so now we have to form this

NOTE Confidence: 0.87085897

3f0d2e2a-fb2b-4f73-bc70-1276776a0ffb
00:47:34.201 --> 00:47:38.866
state table. The state table is
again very similar to the

2fea506e-123c-431e-9237-841d8886d98d
00:47:38.866 --> 00:47:40.636
analysis. Two column for each

NOTE Confidence: 0.7261011

bba75adb-804b-4236-800a-c1f5ba916f62
00:47:40.636 --> 00:47:43.880
flip flops. Current
state next state.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86114496

ea791efc-5e48-4c9c-8d86-b715bd0f1334
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:51.669
So a. 3 flip
flops ABC will pick a

NOTE Confidence: 0.86114496

4f04399f-3107-43a2-8f1b-9f2d239ba365
00:47:51.669 --> 00:47:53.160
name for them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8043066

eabd7648-38b9-44ac-bc93-e4a8b3d36f84
00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:58.478
Because we need 3 memory
units, so we need 3 flip flops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8043066

fe3a8c83-83da-48f0-a9a4-055e1b11597d
00:47:58.478 --> 00:48:03.014
We don't know the type of the
flip flops yet, but we know at

NOTE Confidence: 0.8043066

e8cdc966-c5be-47ad-8bad-a92983091387
00:48:03.014 --> 00:48:07.226
least that we need flip flops.
So ABC will pick a name for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8043066

4429cf27-4340-4392-a501-6d88a19f41d4
00:48:07.226 --> 00:48:11.438
them. The current state of a the
next state of a the current

d3463814-ff3d-437d-a87f-401214cdcba1
00:48:11.438 --> 00:48:15.326
state of B next of B and current
Of C and next of C.

b0bafa05-9549-4bbc-9f25-9c8d4cacda79
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:21.379
And the rows are different
combination of these states.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88402873

9a686b62-1fad-41e1-afad-61d69d4758ad
00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:27.342
So we have to fill out the
design at the state table.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84039915

8bfaa6bd-42eb-472f-89c3-0edcee8212fa
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:32.947
The thing is here, in order to
fill out their state table, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.84039915

26c5b09d-2084-46c1-859a-77332f5948e8
00:48:32.947 --> 00:48:35.979
don't. This is unlike the
analysis a step.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87760484

1d929e49-0747-42fb-9faf-1a4fb1e0c362
00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.955
Here we already knew what's the
next state is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83837235

09386b9d-7e51-45be-9cce-f7cf9b6e5842
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:43.832
Based on the state transition
diagram, we know that from zero

NOTE Confidence: 0.83837235

cd7b1540-8dbd-4b80-ab4a-ed31df44a1e6
00:48:43.832 --> 00:48:45.524
we have to go to one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75781035

43dd5268-be8f-41b8-b81e-0dfd3d44f9fe
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:51.300
So this state table filling out
the state table in In a design.

779561f1-d7e3-47fd-9e81-d6b44b1e7875
00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.000
Task is very easy because we
already know this state

NOTE Confidence: 0.86787885

b7149fbc-cda8-4f66-922f-0a7ab95eef6a
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.224
transition diagram, so we know
that from what is said, we go to

82fefa75-7d40-493d-ba22-fabf609fc064
00:48:58.224 --> 00:49:00.353
what other state. From zero we

NOTE Confidence: 0.73950464

c7abcb7f-b09b-40f4-bd8e-0896a4d81b77
00:49:00.353 --> 00:49:03.585
go to one. from One we go to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8836307

22a2b05d-d82c-4575-962f-1cdecb4a510d
00:49:03.585 --> 00:49:11.530
two. 2 to 3,3 to 4,4 to 5,5 to six, 6 to
7 and from 7. As we said,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8836307

87a50795-98c3-4e20-9810-4c39d05c3acb
00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:18.940
we have two options. Either look
back to 0 or stuck in seven

NOTE Confidence: 0.8836307

432349a4-e1e4-41b8-a0c9-672bf4748cf6
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.790
or look forever in seven.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7529493

b6e06d30-3962-4257-b468-dc7d34c0cd09
00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:28.650
So we continue with the
looping the from 7  back to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7529493

17fc4371-fbda-4421-a1b5-4866229e2e19
00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:34.530
zero and then 0 to 1,2. So we look
forever. If this is design

NOTE Confidence: 0.7529493

70fbff07-d16b-4be6-bd03-79f4f05e526a
00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:39.430
choice you could design based
on storing staying at 7

NOTE Confidence: 0.7529493

5634dc1b-6232-4f38-bc32-0f12e572fcf5
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:43.840
forever, but we continue this
example on this choice.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82814515

d15bad2c-2ed5-42a1-9e11-d3c64b751339
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:53.431
And then up until now, all the
design steps were just based on

NOTE Confidence: 0.82814515

a1469d93-a3cf-483d-aef9-fa8ff7fbcda1
00:49:53.431 --> 00:49:59.635
regardless of the type of the
flip flops. So we picked the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8461583

4ca4a013-7263-407d-b184-05e65ec2aad0
00:49:59.635 --> 00:50:05.185
memory. Memory units we form the
state transition diagram. We

NOTE Confidence: 0.8461583

3201259b-7bcf-4e23-aaf9-66ee1160745c
00:50:05.185 --> 00:50:10.410
form the state table. Now we
want to design the circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80714285

28f1083b-1ac6-4f7a-8b36-2566e44bf87b
00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:16.936
So the this is that you have to
pick a flip flop flip flops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.78829896

fc99c2e2-ddb6-49cc-939a-d921809e41a4
00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:22.096
Either you can choose all the
memory in its kind, big kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.78829896

18ce1b9e-2526-4d01-9f96-febf8136b662
00:50:22.096 --> 00:50:27.541
type of Rs or all the your
memory units become D or T or G

NOTE Confidence: 0.78829896

d62859a8-7aa0-401d-8315-fe29b81e5b22
00:50:27.541 --> 00:50:32.623
or mix. You could say that I
want to pick two JK or one T

NOTE Confidence: 0.78829896

5e606e54-e647-4c0c-9a14-61e035a8d341
00:50:32.623 --> 00:50:37.342
or I want to design this circuit
by 1D and 2T flip flops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85504025

5fdbfdc9-880b-4d16-a6d2-e9e2d57b1d10
00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:41.515
So this is the design choice.
Sometimes in the problem they

NOTE Confidence: 0.85504025

b65825e0-fbb9-4219-8006-ce3172d08a91
00:50:41.515 --> 00:50:46.065
say that we want to design a
circiut only by D flip flops or

NOTE Confidence: 0.85504025

039e9b16-8d8b-4ef4-ab0a-5866cde56e02
00:50:46.065 --> 00:50:49.965
only by JK. But sometimes if
they don't do this is your

NOTE Confidence: 0.85504025

12fa3fff-8c2a-4f63-a343-1462cea67738
00:50:49.965 --> 00:50:53.865
choice to pick one of these flip
flops or mix of them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6565453

f4c336c4-a5d0-44d7-8a9d-158b6b85d54e
00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:57.498
And then, uh.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7558074

32a38307-4e78-461c-bbb2-f1a01795f286
00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:01.162
You could ask what are the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9006458

9b363d9a-2501-4832-9a55-11ae44bf07d3
00:51:01.162 --> 00:51:05.780
preference? So in terms of the
design doesn't matter. You can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9006458

636906bd-29d2-4e70-bee2-b038caa99f38
00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:09.410
choose whatever flip flops you
like. If the problem doesn't state

8611ebd9-c133-48ef-9ba0-8434f4c413ce
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:13.980

efficiency, efficiency as you

combinational design

054e9208-f652-44f5-92fd-4508743298a3
00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:21.020
efficiencies, the less number

92de7bc7-8873-47de-9112-abee8ecb6c7d
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:29.726
We'll see that the choice of the
flip flop flip flops actually

has an impact on the efficiency.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:36.822
But for now, for the design task
we say that we don't care about

NOTE Confidence: 0.87666607

fadc7a7c-27d3-4d35-803e-1ff5ef1cda5d
00:51:36.822 --> 00:51:40.338
the efficiency. For now, we just
care about the efficacy or the.

83196d65-ab3c-4fdc-96bd-2980c98cc88f
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:42.370
Correctness of the design.

dc2434d1-f43f-4932-a646-2f4491043dd1
00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:47.640
Later I mean next lecture. I'm
going to explain this a little

NOTE Confidence: 0.81636155

79b2ef85-db94-4d51-8393-a378f2fba897
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.980
more about the efficiency.

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:57.090
So now we want to count from
zero to 7. We need 3 flip flops

NOTE Confidence: 0.8256841

345f24a6-1615-4eeb-b918-2fe77fa008d2
00:51:57.090 --> 00:52:01.794
and I chose JK because jk
is the complete flip flop. It

4a101e18-fbd5-4a69-b972-c38d5eaabd3c
00:52:01.794 --> 00:52:06.106
has a four actions store, reset,
set and compliment. So let's

720fa021-41bb-41eb-89fd-681b46e18a5d
00:52:06.106 --> 00:52:08.066
design this circuit by JK.

a72a48b6-3799-430c-ad73-5c48010efd75
00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:15.654
So another recap. So from now I
mean because the next few slides

are very important, so so far.

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:23.070
First, we detect we need a
sequential circuit because we

17e43ad6-10d6-41f0-830a-ceeb5768ab37
00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:24.309
need a memory.

fc4463de-b631-4a44-8dff-2d29080ceb7d
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:29.786
Because we want to store
count from zero to 7 and

dd62b2ac-606e-470a-a8a0-f84b8e6f7275
00:52:29.786 --> 00:52:33.746
then from zero to 7, we
need 3 memory units.

c2472bf1-f674-442b-96b9-4d9dbce75304
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:39.242
We formed the state transition

d5d68d66-fcdf-446e-8595-471bd1609ba8
00:52:39.242 --> 00:52:44.296
and then we chose from 7. Go
back to 0. This is the design

8bf82e52-bfa2-4a0b-90ae-a2f67e2b8ef8

8c7cf2ab-010a-46db-8fa8-37d01e085d8b
00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:50.658
And then we picked the JK
flip flops as our memory units.

641886fe-ae60-49e2-97eb-e53b4016e6eb
00:52:50.658 --> 00:52:55.684
We pick a name for them. ABC and

00:54:20.051 --> 00:54:24.432
D flip flops and also the same

00:54:36.436 --> 00:54:40.814

this is correct.

01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:22.580

have any minterms, so.

88aeea82-f911-42cf-b8d8-5ceb0d141b46

that I mean for the don't care

you assume it as a one, but this

now we have the excitation

01:12:15.972 --> 01:12:21.074

it's right 'cause you can either

06cf5765-d24d-4f51-963b-8530f0decd74

faa46351-7b3e-4bbb-b0dd-41c099e4ef47
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:35.460
So Taylor says that either we
did complement means that one

2e592182-4eae-4f41-93ef-515e03169cb3
01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:39.200
one. Or we did reset.

75e6e9a0-cf4f-466a-8f3e-905e74998b6f
01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:46.826
For the reset we
need a 01, oh correct?

20d78d92-7b9f-44d7-aae0-61791174d1d7
01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:51.200
Taylor is right. No, let's let's
fix this right now.

for the compliments.

e89b9ae0-b9ee-4cb3-85ab-cdaf9c16696f
01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:34.282

if you for 1 to 0, if you do

ce8bb884-467a-47f2-91e0-f037426d9a93
01:13:34.282 --> 01:13:37.546

2d939a65-8195-4311-8cc6-06509c73d6f3
01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:42.573
If you do reset from one to
zero, meaning that the reset it

01:13:42.573 --> 01:13:47.347
means that you did zero here and
one here. So in both cases the

6b35372a-bd45-425c-a5f5-2b50e4681c5b
01:13:47.347 --> 01:13:48.711

da6d182a-08ee-4ecd-9181-8bdb48b1839e
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.406
So let's go to the next slide.
So these are the excitation

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:14.660
order to come up with an

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:18.080
minimize that. So you have to
minimize your excitation

62ba6e2f-5e5d-42cb-bce9-f65991ca3928
01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.700

use the 3 variable K map

867a1ccd-fab4-4c4e-88f9-d235a0d61c81
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:28.720

01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:39.156
For each one. So because we have
JK  or we have two inputs

a7e5373f-1c96-4c79-8e00-5f2de08c3983
01:14:39.156 --> 01:14:44.541
for each flip flop we have 3
flip flop. So we have 6 . We

01:17:06.377 --> 01:17:11.912
I assume that from 5 it goes to
six. So let's see it happens or

01:17:14.126 --> 01:17:18.779
101. After the first positive

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:26.520
The input of the flip flop is
both 1, meaning that the

96fece1b-956b-4467-827f-807ff7bca5de
01:17:57.970 --> 01:17:59.158
And then C.
