To Studetns:
1) At the first session and in course outline:
- For marking and any related issue, foremost reach out to your lab instructor, not the marker. Then me!
- For opening another submissions
- Pay attention to naming of files!!
- Explain that some topics are not covered in the lecture, but either in labs or lecture assignments

To TA/GAs
- Do not mark late submissions. Do not even put zero. But put a comment "Late Submission"!
- MANDATORY!! Put specific comment regarding each deduction for each question!
- On time release of markings
- Openning for another submission
- Reason for late submissions, etc
- Sign your name and email after all your comments

To myself:
- Reduce the number of labs so that in the last week, all are marked ==> one week prog. lab, one week math/design lab
- Reduce the number of questions in the lec. assignments
- [Background Check] Make a survey/sample quiz to see the distribution of students over the level of expertise. Some students are from other majors that are not familiar with e.g., math, ...
- Create a separate link for each lab section and introduce the lab instructor
- Shorten the file names
